  abstract = {Following efforts by hundreds of volunteers to count overwintering monarch butterflies in California, the 28th annual Western Monarch Count has reported a peak population of just 9,119 butterflies this winter. This is the second lowest overwintering population ever recorded since tracking began in 1997 and coincides with monarch butterflies being proposed for protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.},

  abstract     = {Concerns about the state of decline of the North American monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) have prompted their consideration for listing under the Endangered Species Act. Data suggest a substantial decline ({\textgreater} 80\%) in overwintering numbers for both eastern and western monarch populations. Making an accurate status assessment is difficult due to highly variable density estimates in the eastern monarch overwintering sites. We have developed a novel application of terrestrial {LiDAR} scanning ({TLS}) which creates a scene using millions of {LASER}-based distance measurements in the landscape. In this technology report we discuss the use of {TLS} and development of Subtractive Volume Estimation ({SVE}) methodology for estimating overwintering monarch butterfly populations. The principle proposition of the {SVE} method is to compare volumetric differences between two {TLS} surveys, a reference scan that records roosting monarch butterflies in their overwintering environment and a derivative scan, that records the same site without butterflies. Using paired long-range laser scanners, we collected data from four overwintering sites; two in California and two in central Mexico. To help estimate the number of butterflies, we developed an accurate 3D model of an individual monarch. To test the {SVE} method, we created digital 3D models of bare tree trunks and distal branches, based on laser scans at two sites and combined them with our monarch model to create virtual reference and derivative point clouds. To convert from volume to number of butterflies, we introduce a scaling factor, n, which represents the estimated volume occupied by one butterfly and a correction factor, f, which accounts for variation in clustering behavior and scanner position. While work is ongoing, we confirm that {TLS} combined with {SVE} is a suitable technique for surveying clusters of overwintering monarchs at overwintering sites in Mexico and the {US}.},
