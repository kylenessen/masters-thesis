  abstract = {Orientation of three species of cockroaches, Blattella germanica, Periplaneta americana and Blaberus craniifer, was monitored in still air and in wind using a servosphere device. In the absence of wind the cockroaches exhibited search behaviour characterized by species-specific patterns of looping and straight locomotory segments. In wind the cockroaches alternated turning left and right rather than looping. Relatively straight course directions were maintained in wind, primarily upwind in B. craniifer and downwind in B. germanica; P. americana ran upwind at low wind velocities and downwind at high wind velocities. The antennae perceive the direction of air currents; for all three species the threshold of wind perception is between 0.015 and 0.03 m/sec.},

  abstract = {Background: Ballooning is the main dispersal mode in small spiders, by which individuals are carried by wind currents as spheres attached to thin silk threads. It involves a typical and unique pre-dispersal `tiptoe' behaviour that can easily be observed under laboratory conditions. Hypotheses: Is the ballooning behaviour of a saltmarsh-inhabiting spider heritable? Do heritability estimates differ under two different environmental conditions (wind velocity)? Organism: Second-instar offspring from Pardosa purbeckensis (Lycosidae; Araneae). Site of experiments: Parents were collected in a large and a small salt marsh. Offspring were tested for behavioural variation under standardized laboratory experiments. Methods: Ballooning motivation (tiptoe behaviour) was assessed at two wind velocities in wind tunnels. We conducted a quantitative (half-sib) genetic analysis of ballooning motivation and applied threshold models to estimate heritabilities under both wind conditions. Results: Heritability estimates were 0.17 (standard error = 0.07) at low wind velocities and 0.42 (standard error = 0.21) at high wind velocities. Because of the absence of a genetic correlation among the two wind environments, independent selection on dispersal motivation under different wind velocities must be prevalent.},

The surface activity of this beetle species was found to be correlated both with time of day and wind speed. Higher numbers were observed on the dune surface between 17:00--19:00 h when wind speeds were consistently higher than 9 m/s. Noise and vibrations in the dune sand were found to be highly dependent on wind speed. Wind blowing at speeds higher than 5 m/s lifts the surface sand grains and generates vibrations in the sand. The peak frequency of these vibrations is in the range of 700--1000 Hz. The vibrational amplitude at the peak frequency is on average 40 dB higher at those wind speeds when the beetles are active compared to lower wind speeds. The results indicate that wind is an important cue for these beetles and can be perceived by buried beetles through substrate vibrations.},

  abstract = {Adequately describing the dispersal mechanisms of a species is important for understanding and predicting its distribution dynamics in space and time. For wind-dispersed species, the transportation of airborne propagules is comparatively well studied, while the mechanisms triggering propagule release are poorly understood, especially for cryptogams. We investigated the effect of wind speed and turbulence on spore release in the moss Atrichum undulatum in a wind tunnel. Specifically, we measured the amount of spores released from sporophytes when exposed to different wind speeds, in high and low turbulence, using a particle counter. We also related spore release to variation in vibrations of the sporophyte and investigated how the vibrations were affected by wind speed, turbulence and sporophyte length (here including capsule, seta and the top part of the shoot). We show that in high turbulence, the amount of spores released increased with increasing wind speed, while in low turbulence, it did not, within the wind speed range 0.8--4.3 m s-1. However, there was a threshold in wind speed ({\texttildelow}2.5--3 m s-1) before large amounts of spores started to be released in turbulent flow, which coincided with incipient vibrations of the sporophyte. Thresholds in wind variation, rather than average wind speed, seemed to initiate sporophyte vibrations. The vibration threshold increased with decreasing sporophyte length. The deposition of spores near the source decreased with increasing wind variation during the time of their release, based on simulated spore deposition from another study of moss dispersal. Synthesis. We suggest that vibration of moss sporophytes is an important mechanism to regulate spore release and that turbulence and sporophyte length regulate the onset of sporophyte vibration. Spore release thresholds affect dispersal distances and have implications for our understanding and predictions of species distribution patterns, population dynamics and persistence. The mechanisms of this phase of the dispersal process are also important to explore for other species, as there may be a substantial variation depending on the species' different traits.},

We allocated individuals to Eucalyptus tereticornis plants and exposed them to zero (control) or moderate wind speeds (3 m/s) for 2 h and quantified their movement patterns. When exposed to wind, individuals dropped from plants, and a greater proportion of individuals were found on petioles, branches, the underside of leaves and the leeward side of plants. The dramatic effects of wind on larval behaviour, even at relatively moderate intensities, reveal the significant potential of wind to influence plant--insect interactions.},

  abstract = {Understanding and predicting complex biological systems are best accomplished through the synthesis and integration of information across relevant spatial, temporal and thematic scales. We propose that mechanistic transport models, which integrate atmospheric turbulence with information on relevant biological attributes, can effectively incorporate key elements of aerial transport processes at scales ranging from a few centimetres and fractions of seconds, to hundreds of kilometres and decades. This capability of mechanistic models is critically important for modelling the flow of organisms through the atmosphere because diverse aerial transport processes --- such as pathogen spread, seed dispersal, spider ballooning and bird migration --- are sensitive to the details of small-scale short-term turbulent deviations from the mean airflow. At the same time, all these processes are strongly influenced by the typical larger-scale variation in landscape structure, through its effects on wind flow patterns. We therefore highlight the useful coupling of detailed atmospheric models such as large eddy simulations (LES), which can provide a high-resolution description of turbulent airflow, with regional atmospheric models, which can capture the effects of landscape heterogeneity at various scales. Further progress in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) will enable rigorous exploration of transport processes in heterogeneous landscapes.},

In the regions where strong wind blows during most part of the day, they concentrate mainly in the places protected from the wind (dry river beds, hollows, and other depressions of the relief). Individuals of different species occurring on the same or neighboring plants usually sing alternately, i.e., demonstrate the same response to each other's signals as to the wind-induced noise.

  abstract = {Despite an upsurge of interest in spatial interactions between communities and in the impact of dispersal on ecological and evolutionary processes, dispersal patterns and dynamics in natural metacommunities remain poorly understood. Although passive aerial dispersal of freshwater invertebrates is generally accepted, the frequency and relative importance of wind as a vector is still subject of considerable debate. We assessed the importance of wind dispersal in an invertebrate metacommunity in a cluster of 36 temporary rock pools on an isolated mountaintop in South Africa. Wind dispersal was quantified every four days using nine windsocks (about 1.5 m above rock base), placed in the field during one month. Distance to the nearest pool varied from 2 up to 16 m. Wind direction and speed were monitored for the entire period. About 850 propagules (mostly resting eggs) of 17 taxa were captured. The presence of water in the pools (level of exposure of the dormant propagule bank) and the dominant wind direction were the key factors affecting the yield. Wind speed was much less important. Our results suggest that wind dispersal of propagules from temporary aquatic systems is more frequent than previously thought. This may stabilise the metacommunity by mediating gene flow among populations and facilitating rapid (re)colonisation of patches. On the other hand, wind erosion of the dormant propagule bank may lead to egg bank depletion and local extinction. The measured frequent wind dispersal most likely fuels strong species sorting processes ultimately shaping the structure of the local communities as observed in an earlier study. To elucidate the link between local dispersal rates and their contribution to long range dispersal is a major challenge for future research on aerial dispersal of aquatic invertebrates.},

However, the strategies that animals use to reduce the impact of wind noise on communication are not well studied. We investigated the effects of wind on the production of tremulatory signals in the neotropical katydid Copiphora brevirostris. First, we recorded katydid signaling activity and natural wind variation in the field. Additionally, we exposed katydid couples during their most active signaling time period to artificial wind of different levels, and we recorded the number of tremulations produced by the males. We found that wind levels are at their lowest between 2:00 and 5:00 in the morning, which coincides with peak signaling period for male katydids. Furthermore, we found that males produce significantly fewer tremulations when exposed to wind rather than acoustic noise or silence. Wind velocity significantly affected the number of tremulations produced during the wind treatment, with fewer tremulations produced with higher wind velocities. Our results show that katydids can time their vibratory signaling both in the short- and long-term to favorable sensory conditions, either through behavioral flexibility in response to short-term fluctuations in wind or as a result of an evolutionary process in response to predictable periods of low-wind conditions.},
