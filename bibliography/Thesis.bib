  abstract = {Abstract. 1. At their high-altitude overwintering sites in Mexico, monarch butterflies frequently are subjected to sub-zero°C temperatures during December-March. Although monarchs have moderate supercooling ability, two ecological factors strongly influence their capacity to resist freezing: wetting and exposure to the clear night sky. 2. As shown in Fig. 2, 50\% of a population of butterflies with water on their body surfaces freeze at warmer sub-zero temperatures (-4.2°C) compared to butterflies with no water on their bodies (-7.7°C). 100\% mortality occurs, respectively, at −7.7°C and −15°C. 3. Comparative measurements of rainfall within a large overwintering colony in Mexico indicated that the intact canopy acts as an umbrella that reduces butterfly wetting during winter storms. 4. Variable experimental exposure of butterflies to the clear night sky indicated that openings in the forest canopy increases radiational cooling and causes monarch body temperatures to drop as much as 4°C below ambient air temperature. Monarchs under dense cover had body temperatures approximately the same as the ambient air temperature, but more exposed individuals had body temperatures below ambient in direct proportion to the degree of exposure. Consequently, forest thinning increases the probability that the butterflies will freeze to death. 5. Whereas both wetting and exposure are increased by disturbance of the forest canopy, the interaction of these two factors exacerbates freezing mortality during winter storms: 50\% of dry and unexposed butterflies froze at −8°C, whereas wetted and fully exposed butterflies froze at only −0.5°C. 6. Butterflies inside and on the bottom of the fir bough clusters are better protected from wetting than those on the outside. This supports the hypothesis that the structure of the butterfly clusters has evolved through individual selection to avoid wetting. 7. The data strongly reinforce previous evidence that forest thinning should be totally prevented within and adjacent to the overwintering sites in order to minimize both wetting and exposure of the butterflies that synergistically increase winter mortality at the overwintering sites in Mexico.},

  abstract = {Invertebrates are the main components of faunal diversity in grasslands, playing substantial roles in ecosystem processes including nutrient cycling and pollination. Grassland invertebrate communities are heavily dependent on the plant diversity and production within a given system. Climate change models predict alterations in precipitation patterns, both in terms of the amount of total inputs and the frequency, seasonality and intensity with which these inputs occur, which will impact grassland productivity. Given the ecological, economic and biodiversity value of grasslands, and their importance globally as areas of carbon storage and agricultural development, it is in our interest to understand how predicted alterations in precipitation patterns will affect grasslands and the invertebrate communities they contain. Here we review the findings from manipulative and observational studies which have examined invertebrate responses to altered rainfall, with a particular focus on large-scale field experiments employing precipitation manipulations. Given the tight associations between invertebrate communities and their underlying plant communities, invertebrate responses to altered precipitation generally mirror those of the plants in the system. However, there is evidence that species responses to future precipitation changes will be idiosyncratic and context dependent across trophic levels, challenging our ability to make reliable predictions about how grassland communities will respond to future climatic changes, without further investigation. Thus, moving forward, we recommend increased consideration of invertebrate communities in current and future rainfall manipulation platforms, as well as the adoption of new technologies to aid such studies.},

  abstract = {The climatic variability hypothesis (CVH) is a cornerstone of thermal ecology, predicting the evolution of wider organismal thermal tolerance ranges in more thermally variable environments. Thermal tolerance ranges depend on both upper and lower tolerance limits (critical thermal maxima [CTmax⁡CTmax⁡] and critical thermal minima [CTmin⁡CTmin⁡]), which may show different responses to environmental gradients. To delineate the relative effects of mean and extreme temperatures on thermal tolerances, we conducted a within-latitude comparative test of CVH predictions for army ants (Dorylinae) at multiple scales: across elevations, in seasonal versus aseasonal forests, and in subterranean versus surface microhabitats. Consistent with the CVH, thermally buffered subterranean species had narrower thermal tolerance ranges. Both CTmin⁡CTmin⁡ and CTmax⁡CTmax⁡ decreased with elevation for subterranean species. In contrast, aboveground species (those exposed to insolation) showed a decrease in CTmin⁡CTmin⁡ but no change in CTmax⁡CTmax⁡ across elevations. Furthermore, greater seasonal temperature variation in dry forests correlated with increased CTmax⁡CTmax⁡ but not CTmin⁡CTmin⁡. These patterns suggest that CTmax⁡CTmax⁡ and CTmin⁡CTmin⁡ respond to different abiotic selective forces: habitat-specific exposure to extreme insolation corresponds to CTmax⁡CTmax⁡ differences but not to CTmin⁡CTmin⁡ variation. We predict that increasingly frequent heat spikes associated with climate change will have habitat-specific physiological consequences for ectothermic animals. Models predicting climate change impacts should account for species microhabitat uses and within-latitude differences in temperature seasonality.},

  abstract = {Two congeneric damselfly species, Enallagma traviatum and E. aspersum, dominate the littoral macroinvertebrates of Bays Mountain Lake and of the adjacent fish-free Ecology Pond, respectively (northeastern Tennessee, USA). Extending previous experimental studies, we test seven hypotheses concerning the role of fish (bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus) and larvaldragonfly (Anax junius) predation, competitive effects on damselflies, and the interaction between competition and predation, in determining invertebrate dominance in these communities. Three types of experiments were conducted: an enclosure experiment within Ecology Pond, an outdoor replicated tub experiment, and a laboratory behavior experiment. The in-situ enclosure experiment showed that E. traviatum larvae were more susceptible to Anax predation than were E. aspersum larvae; a tendency toward greater vulnerability to fish of E. aspersum compared with E. traviatum was not statistically significant. The outdoor tub experiment confirmed both of these trends with statistically significant results. In the tubs, both predators inhibited feeding of both zygopterans (as indicated by reduced fecal mass), particularly for E. aspersum in the presence of fish. This effect appears to have been primarily indirect, mediated through exploitation of the zooplankton. We also detected competitive effects of E. traviatum on E. aspersum: E. traviatum reduced the emergence and increased the exposure above the substrate of E. aspersum. In the absence of predators, E. traviatum inhibited feeding of E. aspersum via interference. In the laboratory behavior experiment, predators inhibited crawling by E. aspersum. E. aspersum was more exposed than was E. traviatum; it swam and crawled more than did E. traviatum, considerably increasing these movements at night. Over all, E. traviatum consistently appeared to be the more cryptic of the two species, and E. aspersum appeared to be much more active. Our results suggest an explanation for the clear difference in structure between communities like Bays Mountain Lake and Ecology Pond: predaceous fish eliminate large invertebrate predators and shift the community toward cryptic forms at relatively low densities, reflecting the effects of both predation and exploitation competition. In the absence of fish, large invertebrate predators are less able to deplete littoral invertebrates but may favor the more active forms, perhaps because these are better able to avoid invertebrate predators.},

Hypotheses: Is the ballooning behaviour of a saltmarsh-inhabiting spider heritable? Do heritability estimates differ under two different environmental conditions (wind velocity)? Organism: Second-instar offspring from Pardosa purbeckensis (Lycosidae; Araneae). Site of experiments: Parents were collected in a large and a small salt marsh. Offspring were tested for behavioural variation under standardized laboratory experiments. Methods: Ballooning motivation (tiptoe behaviour) was assessed at two wind velocities in wind tunnels. We conducted a quantitative (half-sib) genetic analysis of ballooning motivation and applied threshold models to estimate heritabilities under both wind conditions. Results: Heritability estimates were 0.17 (standard error = 0.07) at low wind velocities and 0.42 (standard error = 0.21) at high wind velocities. Because of the absence of a genetic correlation among the two wind environments, independent selection on dispersal motivation under different wind velocities must be prevalent.},

A conservative calculation of mortality through the 135 day overwintering season was 2.034 million butterflies, or about 9\% of the colony. The birds preyed selectively upon male butterflies, possibly because of a difference in fat content, or possibly because females contain higher concentrations and larger amounts of cardenolide or other defensive chemicals. The risk to individual monarchs of being killed was much greater on the colony periphery and in thinned areas of the forest. Bird predation thus is sufficient to have played a major role in shaping the evolution of the monarch's overwintering and aggregation behavior.},

  abstract = {Since 1857, amateurs and professionals have woven a rich tapestry of biological information about the monarch butterfly's migration in North America. Huge fall migrations were first noted in the midwestern states, and then eastward to the Atlantic coast. Plowing of the prairies together with clearing of the eastern forests promoted the growth of the milkweed, Asclepias syriaca, and probably extended the center of breeding from the prairie states into the Great Lakes region. Discovery of overwintering sites along the California coast in 1881 and the failure to find consistent overwintering areas in the east confused everyone for nearly a century. Where did the millions of monarchs migrating southward east of the Rocky Mountains spend the winter before their spring remigration back in to the eastern United States and southern Canada? Through most of the 20th century, the Gulf coast was assumed to be the wintering area, but recent studies rule this out because adults lack sufficient freezing resistance to survive the recurrent severe frosts. Seizing the initiative after C. B. Williams' (1930) review of monarch migration, Fred and Norah Urquhart developed a program that gained the interest of legions of naturalists who tagged and released thousands of monarchs to trace their migration. Just as doubts in the early 1970s over whether there really were overwintering aggregations of the eastern population, on 2 January 1975 two Urquhart collaborators, Kenneth and Cathy Brugger, discovered millions of monarchs overwintering high in the volcanic mountains of central Mexico. This allowed a synthesis of the biology of this remarkable insect, including its migration and overwintering behaviors, its spread across the Pacific Ocean to Australia, its coevolution with milkweeds, and its elaborate milkweed-derived chemical defense which probably makes possible the dense aggregations during the fall migration and at the overwintering sites. Many important questions remain. Can monarchs migrate across the Gulf of Mexico? Can they migrate at night? Do they exploit strong tailwinds? Do they migrate to Central America? Do they overwinter elsewhere in Mexico or Central America? How much interchange is there between the eastern and western North American populations? How important is the fall migration along the Atlantic coast compared to the migration west of the Appalachian Mountains? What causes annual fluctuations in the size of the fall migrations? Beautiful and mysterious, the monarch's overwintering colonies in Mexico rank as one of the great biological wonders of the world. Unfortunately, these colonies are the monarch's Achilles' heel because of human population growth and deforestation in the tiny Oyamel fir forest enclaves. Additional risks arise from the increasing use of herbicides across North America which kill both larval and adult food resources. As a result, the migratory and overwintering biology of the eastern population of the monarch butterfly has become an endangered biological phenomenon. Without immediate implementation of effective conservation measures in Mexico, the eastern migration phenomenon may soon become biological history. In writing this paper for Charles Remington's honorarial issue of the Journal of the Lepidopterists' Society, fond memories flood forth of my days as his graduate student at Yale University from 1953 to 1957. My very first seminar lecture was on the migration of the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus (L.), and this set the stage for what will soon be 40 years of studying diverse aspects of the biology of this VOLUME 49, NUMBER 4 305 fascinating creature (reviews in Brower 1977a, 1984, 1985a, 1985b, 1986, 1987b, 1988, 1992). The present paper reconstructs the history of understanding the migration of the monarch butterfly in North America. To my knowledge, a detailed analysis of the ideas and the people who developed them has never been attempted. The story, a result of the combined observations of professional and amateur lepidopterists over more than a century, reflects the spirit in which Charles Remington, then a graduate student at Harvard, and his friend and colleague Harry Clench founded The Lepidopterists' Society in 1947 (Clench 1977). My purpose is to weave together the strands, to follow some of the red herrings, and to discuss several aspects of the migration biology that are still incompletely understood. Timely resolution of these questions should enhance efforts to preserve the monarch's mass migratory and overwintering behaviors which, regrettably, have become an endangered biological phenomenon (Brower \& Pyle 1980, Brower \& Malcolm 1989, 1991). The first great student of the monarch butterfly was Charles Valentine Riley, who emigrated from England and rose to lead midwestern, and then national entomology in the USA (Packard 1896, Essig 1931). In addition to being a first rate scientist, Riley was a talented artist who beautifully illustrated his descriptions of insect natural histories, and he fostered the English tradition of collating and publishing letters from a diversity of field observers, including many on the migration of the monarch. Anecdotal science on the monarch predominated well into the 20th century. In 1930, C. B. Williams of Edinburgh University reviewed monarch migration in his book, The Migration of Butterflies, which he periodically updated (Williams 1938, 1958, Williams et al. 1942). Shortly after the founding of The Lepidopterists' Society, Williams (1949:18) called for information from members and defined questions for much of the migration research that would follow: "What happens to the butterflies that fly through Texas in the fall? Do they go on to Mexico? If so, do they hibernate there, or remain active, or breed?" University of Toronto entomologist Fred A. Urquhart and his wife Norah took up the Williams challenge in 1940 and began tracing the fall migration of the monarch via a long-term tagging program, which would come to involve more than 3,000 research associates (Urquhart 1941,1952,1960,1978,1979,1987, Anon. 1955). The Urquharts communicated with their collaborators through an annual newsletter, published numerous papers on monarch biology, and carried on the tradition of incorporating amateurs' notes in their writings. According to Urquhart and Urquhart (1994), the final newsletter to their Insect Migration Association was issued as Volume 33 in 1994. Speculations about the destination of the eastern monarch migration 306 JOURNAL OF THE LEPIDOPTERISTS' SOCIETY became increasingly confused throughout the first three quarters of the 20th century because of the mysterious disappearance of what had to be vast numbers of butterflies that annually bred over an area of at least three million square kilometers. Many tortuous hypotheses were devised until resolution came in Urquhart's August 1976 National Geographic article announcing the discovery of the phenomenal overwintering aggregations in Mexico. This culmination of the Urquharts' lifetime efforts was one of the great events in the history of lepidopterology. FIRST OBSERVATIONS OF THE FALL MIGRATION: REPORTS FROM KANSAS TO CONNECTICUT Aside from a possible sighting of monarchs migrating in eastern Mexico during one of Christopher Columbus's expeditions (Doubleday \& Westwood 1846-1852:91), D'Urban (1857) was apparently the first to report a migration of monarch butterflies. He described the butterflies appearing in the Mississippi Valley in "such vast numbers as to darken the air by the clouds of them" (p. 349). During September 1867 in southwestern Iowa, Allen (in Scudder \& Allen 1869) described monarchs gathered in several groves of trees bordering the prairie "in such vast numbers, on the lee sides of trees, and particularly on the lower branches, as almost to hide the foliage, and give to the trees their own peculiar color" (p. 331). Although this clustering behavior was initially interpreted as a means of avoiding strong prairie winds, it soon became evident that it was associated with large southward movements of monarchs in the fall. The first collated evidence of massive fall migrations was published in 1868 by two American entomologists, Benjamin Dann Walsh and Charles Valentine Riley, who had independently emigrated from England to Illinois and were both keen to establish entomology as a science useful to farmers. Additionally, as evidenced in Darwin's correspondence (in F. Darwin and Seward 1903a:248-251, 1903b:385-386), Walsh and Riley were both influenced by The Origin of Species (Darwin 1859). Walsh, born in 1808, developed his interest in insects when he was nearly 50 years old, and launched his career in 1865 as associate editor of the Practical Entomologist in which he wrote, reprinted and edited numerous articles and letters, and answered letters from curious people and farmers besieged by insect pests. Within a decade he became the first Illinois State Entomologist (Riley 1870, Darwin and Seward 1903a). In contrast, Riley, born in 1843, had left his family home in England at the age of 17.

  abstract = {Climate change is expected to alter rainfall and temperature regimes across the world. The hydrology and riparian zone vegetation of lotic ecosystems are tightly linked to rainfall and a mechanistic understanding of the effects of rainfall on lotic ecosystems is needed to forecast the ecological impacts of climate change. However, it is difficult to isolate rainfall effects from other environmental variables that covary across climates. To address this, we leveraged a unique steep rainfall gradient with few covarying changes in elevation, temperature, and geology to evaluate the effects of rainfall on stream invertebrate communities. We surveyed nine streams in the Texas Gulf Coast Prairie distributed along a 550–1,350 mm/year rainfall gradient. Four sites were classified as drier semi-arid streams ({$<$}750 mm annual rainfall) and five sites were classified as wetter sub-humid streams ({$>$}750 mm annual rainfall). A suite of characteristics including benthic invertebrate community metrics, flow conditions, and water quality variables were assessed monthly for 14 months at each site to relate precipitation regime to stream structure and function. Precipitation regime was observed to be a master explanatory variable. As annual rainfall increased, the flow environment became more stable within seasons and predictable across seasons, influencing spatial structure and temporal variability of invertebrate community composition. Wetter streams were dominated by slower growing taxa without adaptions for desiccation resistance and strong dispersal. Wetter sites displayed seasonal variation in community composition and species richness, whereas temporal variation in communities in drier streams was controlled by stochastic variation in flow conditions. These observations show that differences in local annual rainfall correlated with major changes to community structure and functional composition. We hypothesise that this association is related to the connection of rainfall to hydrological stability, particularly the frequency of low flow disturbances, and the subsequent effects on riparian vegetation and temporally available niches to stream invertebrates. Our work adds to evidence that alterations in precipitation patterns associated with climate change have sweeping impacts on lotic fauna.},

Thus, the predicted metabolic requirements for an inactive butterfly during their quiescent period from late November to late January was 30.32 joules per day. 5. In contrast to the steady depletion of fat reserves during their quiescent period in December and January, low and stable fat levels of butterflies in late February coincide with high levels of flight activity, mating and emigration of females from the colony. 6.

We investigated physiological responses (respiration and heart beat rate) of the ectotherm limpet Patella vulgata to heat stress events during emersion and the role of seasonal and microclimatic acclimatization for individual thermal tolerance limits. Individuals were collected from 5 microhabitats characterized by different exposure to solar radiation in the high intertidal zone of a semi-exposed rocky shore in winter and summer of 2014. Upper thermal tolerance limits (heat coma temperatures – HCTs, and heart rate Arrhenius break temperatures - ABTs) were determined for individuals from each microhabitat in both seasons under laboratory conditions. While we found a clear seasonal acclimatization, i.e., higher HCTs and ABTs in summer than in winter, we did not find evidence for microhabitat-specific responses that would suggest microclimatic acclimatization. However, operative limpet temperatures derived from in-situ temperature measurements suggest that individuals from sun exposed microhabitats have a much narrower thermal safety margins than those from less exposed surfaces or within crevices. Microhabitat specific thermal safety margins caused by high thermal heterogeneity at small spatial scales and the lack of short term acclimatization will likely shape small scale distribution patterns of intertidal species in response to the predicted increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves.},

  abstract = {In the context of global environmental change much of the focus has been on changing temperatures. However, patterns of rainfall and water availability have also been changing and are expected to continue doing so. In consequence, understanding the responses of insects to water availability is important, especially because it has a pronounced influence on insect activity, distribution patterns, and species richness. Here we therefore provide a critical review of key questions that either are being or need to be addressed in this field. First, an overview of insect behavioural responses to changing humidity conditions and the mechanisms underlying sensing of humidity variation is provided. The primary sensors in insects belong to the temperature receptor protein superfamily of cation channels. Temperature-activated transient receptor potential ion channels, or thermoTRPs, respond to a diverse range of stimuli and may be a primary integrator of sensory information, such as environmental temperature and moisture. Next we touch briefly on the components of water loss, drawing attention to a new, universal model of the water costs of gas exchange and its implications for responses to a warming, and in places drying, world. We also provide an overview of new understanding of the role of the sub-elytral chamber for water conservation, and developments in understanding of the role of cuticular hydrocarbons in preventing water loss. Because of an increasing focus on the molecular basis of responses to dehydration stress we touch briefly on this area, drawing attention to the role of sugars, heat shock proteins, aquaporins, and LEA proteins. Next we consider phenotypic plasticity or acclimation responses in insect water balance after initial exposures to altered humidity, temperature or nutrition. Although beneficial acclimation has been demonstrated in several instances, this is not always the case. Laboratory studies show that responses to selection for enhanced ability to survive water stress do evolve and that genetic variation for traits underlying such responses does exist in many species. However, in others, especially tropical, typically narrowly distributed species, this appears not to be the case. Using the above information we then demonstrate that habitat alteration, climate change, biological invasions, pollution and overexploitation are likely to be having considerable effects on insect populations mediated through physiological responses (or the lack thereof) to water stress, and that these effects may often be non-intuitive.},

  abstract = {Understanding the factors associated with declines of at-risk species is an important first step in setting management and recovery targets. This step can be challenging when multiple aspects of climate and land use are changing simultaneously, and any or all could be contributing to population declines. We analyzed population trends of monarch butterflies in western North America in relation to likely environmental drivers. Unlike the larger eastern monarch population, past analyses of western monarchs have only evaluated the importance of climate (i.e., not land use) factors as drivers of abundance. We used partial least squares regression (PLSR) to evaluate the potential importance of changes in land use and climate variables. Trends in western monarch abundance were more strongly associated with land use variables than climate variables. Conclusions about importance of climate and land use variables were robust to changes in PLSR model structure. However, individual variables were too collinear to unambiguously separate their effects. We compared these conclusions to the more widely used technique of multiple regression, followed by multi-model inference (MRMI). Na€ıve interpretation of MRMI results could be misleading, if collinearity were not taken into account. MRMI was also highly sensitive to variation in model construction. Our results suggest a two-pronged approach to monarch conservation, specifically, starting efforts now to restore habitat, while also using experiments to more clearly delineate separate effects of climate and land use factors. They also demonstrate the utility of PLSR, a technique that is growing in use but is still relatively under-appreciated in conservation biology.},

Polar terrestrial invertebrates express a suite of physiological, biochemical and genomic features in response to these stressors. However, the situation is not as simple as responding to each stressor in isolation, as they are often faced in combination. We consider how polar terrestrial invertebrates manage this scenario in light of their physiology and ecology. Climate change is also leading to warmer summers in parts of the polar regions, concomitantly increasing the potential for drought. The interaction between high temperature and low water availability, and the invertebrates׳ response to them, are therefore also explored.},

Grove locations are known from recent and historical surveys and a long-term citizen science database. The climatic niche model performs well, predicting that overwintering habitat is most likely to occur along the coast and at low elevations, as shown by empirical data. We then use climatic variables in conjunction with climate change scenarios to model the future location of overwintering habitat, and find a substantial shift in the predicted distribution. Under a plausible scenario, the probability of occurrence of overwintering habitat directly reflects elevation, with coastal regions having a reduced probability relative to today, and higher elevation sites increasing in probability. Under a more extreme scenario, high probability sites are only located along ridgelines and in mountaintop regions of the county. This predicted shift in distribution is likely to have management implications, as sites that currently lack monarchs may become critical to conservation in the future. Our results suggest that estimating the size of the western overwintering population in the future will be problematic, unless annual counts compensate for a shift in the distribution and a potential change in the number and location of occupied sites.},

  abstract = {Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) of the western United States are famous for their annual fall migration from inland and northern summer breeding ranges to their coastal overwintering grounds in California. Despite their notoriety, there is still a limited understanding around their overwintering biology, and apparent habitat selection that results in their coastal distribution of overwintering grounds spanning from Mendocino County to Baja California. As ectotherms, however, temperature and climate play a large role in how they interact with the ecosystems of California, from migration to overwintering. As a population of special concern that is currently under review for listing, understanding the relationships between monarchs and the habitat they select will be imperative to well-informed conservation strategies. In Chapter 1, we review existing literature and summarize how temperature influences survivorship of various life stages of monarch butterflies (egg, larva/pupa, adult, and overwintering adult). We also review the terminology associated with dormancy, including diapause and quiescence. We focus on temperature as a determinant of egg development together and separately from the transition out of diapause. We find that monarch butterfly ecophysiology is sufficiently well understood to argue that western monarchs experience a true diapause that likely ends in late fall (December) rather than in late winter (February) and is likely followed by a late winter quiescence period. This review also provides a comprehensive ecophysiological context for discussing the effects of climate and climate change on overwintering western monarch butterfly diapause and breeding behavior. Here, we review and compile available microclimate and landscape-level temperature data for overwintering grounds. Our heuristic analysis suggests that monarch butterflies in the west may be overwintering (in some sites and in some years) at the upper thermal threshold of egg development and release from dormancy. Ultimately, this review of literature and comparison to climatic data for overwintering groves provides a comprehensive physiological context to generate new hypotheses of regional effects of climate change on various life stages and reproductive productivity. In Chapter 2, we review the body of literature describing physical overwintering site characteristics commonly re-cited, and identify the level of empirical support provided for each. For several untested physical characteristics such as slope and aspect, we measure their values at overwintering groves and statistically compare them to randomly generated paired sites. Thereby we test for attribute selection at the level of the entire grove. Our results demonstrate that two untested, but frequently re-cited characteristics of overwintering groves (south-west facing aspect and non-ephemeral water), may just reflect common characteristics of coastal topography rather than preference or selection at the grove-scale. Our results support habitat selection for locations near the coast, at low elevations, and with gentle slopes. Thus, we further resolve habitat characteristics that are and are not selected by overwintering monarchs at this scale. In Chapter 3, we generated a hierarchical species distribution model (SDM) that identifies regions and habitat characteristics which influence migratory and overwintering monarchs. We evaluated population-wide climatic and local landscape-level predictors of migratory and overwintering habitat for western monarch butterflies using community-science presence data. The population-wide model output of suitability was integrated as an attribute into the local-scale  v model to generate hierarchically nested predictions for peak habitat suitability. The top climatic predictor at the population-wide scale was minimum temperature in December, with an 83.7\% contribution to the model. At the localized scale, the strongest predictor of presence (aside from the population-wide output) was percent cover for low and medium levels of development. Development had a strong positive association with overwintering monarch presence, which is counterintuitive. While the local-scale model results suggested peak habitat suitability coincided with the coastal zone of California, they also suggested an overfit to the urban development predictors. Overwintering sites were associated with the coastal zone, which is well-developed in California. It is unclear whether monarchs were truly selecting overwintering sites closer to human development; whether they are forced into those sites because they are the best available remaining locations for overwintering; or if detection of overwintering sites was biased closer to developed areas. Overall, climatic variables had the most predictive value, and systematic/randomized sampling for overwintering habitat outside of heavily populated zones may be necessary to discern the best predictors of peak habitat suitability.},

  abstract = {The behavioral ecology of monarch butterflies, Danaus plexippus (L.), was studied during the 1988-1989 and 1989-1990 overwintering seasons at two central coastal sites in San Luis Obispo County, Calif., that differ in stand composition. In both seasons, patterns of tree use were similar at both sites; fewer trees supported clustering individuals as the season progressed, even though population levels remained constant. Tree use was not random, and as few as 3\% of the available trees accounted for 97\% of the clustering. A method of describing the location of clusters on specific trees was developed. Roosting individuals were consistently found on the southern exposures of trees, and cluster locations varied neither diurnally nor seasonally. Microclimate variables such as solar radiation, temperature, and wind were not good predictors of clustering position on trees within sites.},

This paper is often cited when addressing some of the typical properties and charactersitics of such groves. It used some of the same methodologies as the Leong papers (Leong is a co-author), but is more transparent about the limitations around the conclusions that can be drawn. Overall, interesting anecdotes about monarch behavior and lots of potential directions to follow from here.},

  abstract = {Due to the thermal buffering of their environment, aquatic invertebrates are less likely than their terrestrial counterparts to face temperatures substantially below 0°C. Aquatic invertebrates may not be able to avoid internal freezing by supercooling (remaining unfrozen at temperatures below the freezing point of their body fluids), however, because when their body temperatures reach the freezing point of body fluids, these organisms will likely be in contact with external ice, which may induce formation of internal ice (i.e., inoculative freezing). In this study, a variety of winter-collected, aquatic invertebrates (a clam, Sphaerium sp.; an isopod, Lirceus fontinalis; a mayfly, Stenomena femoratum; a belostomatid, Belostoma flumineum; 2 dytiscids, Ilybius oblitus and Agabus disintegratus) and, for comparison, a terrestrial beetle (Hippodamia convergens) were studied with respect to their low temperature tolerance. No species appeared to lower its freezing point appreciably by accumulating colligatively active solutes in body fluids, and all aquatic species supercooled moderately (-5 to -7°C), but significantly less than the terrestrial beetle (-16°C), before freezing when chilled in a dry environment. However, when chilled in contact with external ice, all animals froze at their melting points or just below (as low as ∼-2°C for the beetles), showing that they are susceptible to inoculative freezing. All aquatic species readily survived exposures to sub-zero temperatures when supercooled, but succumbed to the same conditions when inoculated by external ice. Survival of low temperatures by temperate zone aquatic invertebrates appears to depend upon thermal buffering provided by the aquatic environment, slow progress of ice formation in bodies of water at high sub-zero temperatures, avoidance of contact with external ice, and tolerance of high sub-zero temperatures when freezing does not occur in the animals themselves.},

Higher numbers were observed on the dune surface between 17:00–19:00 h when wind speeds were consistently higher than 9 m/s. Noise and vibrations in the dune sand were found to be highly dependent on wind speed. Wind blowing at speeds higher than 5 m/s lifts the surface sand grains and generates vibrations in the sand. The peak frequency of these vibrations is in the range of 700–1000 Hz. The vibrational amplitude at the peak frequency is on average 40 dB higher at those wind speeds when the beetles are active compared to lower wind speeds. The results indicate that wind is an important cue for these beetles and can be perceived by buried beetles through substrate vibrations.},

We examined the seasonal and diel patterns of invertebrate drift in relation to seston and various habitat characteristics in two each of four different kinds of alpine streams [rhithral (snow-fed) lake outlets, rhithral streams, kryal (glacial-fed) lake outlets and kryal streams]. Samples were collected at four times of the day (dawn, midday, dusk and midnight) during three seasons (spring, summer and autumn). 2. Habitat characteristics differed mainly between rhithral and kryal sites, with the latter having higher discharge and turbidity, lower water temperature, and higher concentrations of ammonium, and particulate and soluble reactive phosphorus. Seasonality in habitat characteristics was most pronounced for kryal streams with autumn samples being more similar to rhithral sites. 3. The concentration of seston was lowest in the glacial-influenced lake outlets and slightly higher in the stream sites; no seasonal or diel patterns were evident. 4. The density of drifting invertebrates averaged less than 100 m−3 and was lowest ({$<$}10 m−3) at three of the four kryal sites. Taxon richness and diversity were lowest at rhithral lake outlets. Chironomidae dominated the drift as well as benthic communities and {$<$}30\% of benthic taxa identified were found in the drift. 5. Drifting invertebrates showed no consistent seasonal pattern. However, density tended to be highest in spring at rhithral sites and in autumn at kryal sites. No diel periodicity in drift density was found at any site and the lack of diel pattern may be a general feature of high altitude streams. 6. Glacially influenced habitat parameters were a major factor affecting drift in these alpine streams, whereas no clear differences were observed between streams and lake outlets. Our findings indicate that invertebrate drift in alpine streams is primarily influenced by abiotic factors, and therefore, substantially differs from patterns observed at lower altitude.},

  abstract = {SYNOPSIS. Marine invertebrates develop in waters that extend from the poles to the equator, experiencing the full range of environmental temperature and food conditions. How selection has modified their development under the influence of these two factors has been a matter of debate. In this paper we argue that the primary influence on developmental rate is temperature, while other factors such as food availability are much less important. From existing literature we demonstrate that (1) developmental rates of both lecithotrophic and planktotrophic asteroids decrease in a similar way from the tropics to the poles, as they do also in other groups of invertebrates (echinoids, molluscs, crustaceans), and (2) rates of development at any one temperature cluster around the function describing the effect of temperature, without any relationship to egg size, suggesting that developmental rates are near the maximum for a given temperature regardless of other variables such as nutrition. We also investigated the response of development to temperature in four species of planktotrophic asteroids, one tropical, one temperate, two polar. There was limited temperature compensation among these four species, but little or no apparent ability to compensate for the retarding effects of reduced temperature within species. Arrhenius analysis of the data suggests that Q10 values for the upper region of each species' tolerance range are approximately 2, indicating that enzyme-based reactions have evolved to be closely integrated with uncatalyzed, temperature-dependent, physicalchemical processes. Values of Q10 at lower regions of the tolerance range, on the other hand, range between 9.5 and 14.7, indicative of abrupt temperature-dependent shifts in reaction equilibria, or in the organization of macromolecules and membranes. We conclude that temperature itself, rather than egg size, food, or other variables, best explains observed latitudinal differences in developmental rates in marine invertebrates.},

  abstract = {Soil invertebrate survival in freezing temperatures has generally been considered in the light of the physiological adaptations seen in surface living insects. These adaptations, notably the ability to supercool, have evolved in concert with surface invertebrates' ability to retain body water in a dry environment. However, most soil invertebrates are orders of magnitude less resistant to desiccation than these truly terrestrial insects, opening the possibility that the mechanisms involved in their cold-hardiness are also of a radically different nature. Permeable soil invertebrates dehydrate when exposed in frozen soil. This dehydration occurs because the water vapor pressure of supercooled water is higher than that of ice at the same temperature. The force of this vapor pressure difference is so large that even a few degrees of supercooling will result in substantial water loss, continuing until the vapor pressure of body fluids equals that of the surrounding ice. At this stage, the risk of tissue ice formation has been eliminated, and subzero survival is ensured. Here we show that these soil invertebrates do not base their winter survival on supercooling, as do many other ectotherms, but instead dehydrate and equilibrate their body-fluid melting point to the ambient temperature. They can achieve this equilibration even at the extreme cooling rates seen in polar soils.},

  abstract = {We summarized studies on the impacts and scale effects of negative (competition, predation, parasitism, herbivory) and positive (mutualism, commensalism, indirect facilitation) species interactions in freshwater benthic habitats since ∼1986 and focused on organisms with mainly or entirely aquatic life cycles. Benthologists publishing in J-NABS have contributed robustly to our overall knowledge of predation and herbivory but less so of other species interactions. Predators can limit the abundance of benthic prey and affect prey size or age structure, behavior, and morphology, and these effects can be transmitted through food webs and ecosystems. Herbivores can limit biomass of benthic algae, alter physiognomy, species composition and diversity, and stoichiometry, and exert strong indirect effects within food webs and nutrient cycles. Parasites can alter host behavior or morphology, but few studies have shown that lethal/sublethal effects of parasites on their hosts have population- or community-scale consequences. Fishes and macroinvertebrates occasionally experience competition, but the effect of competition on demographies and assemblages appears restricted to local scales, perhaps because competition can be modulated by many biotic (bioenergetic efficiency, parasitism, predation) and abiotic (floods, drought, resource distribution) factors. Positive interactions have been the least studied species interaction by benthologists, but interest is growing. Future study of population-scale positive interactions and nontraditional interactions at larger scales (e.g., riparian effects on benthic habitat stabilization, cross-system recruitment of different life stages) will improve our understanding of freshwater benthic ecosystems and their conservation. We urge benthologists to explore how populations evolve in response to biotic interactions embedded in benthic communities and to assess how these responses might redefine trophic and community structure and their emergent properties.},

The magnitude of this change (ΔpH/Δ°C) is very similar to the change of the pH of water with temperature (ΔpN/Δ°C) and suggests that these invertebrates, like poikilothermous vertebrates, regulate the pH of their extracellular fluid so that its degree of alkalinity relative to the pH of water remains constant. The degree of alkalinity (pHblood-pN) varies between species, but seems to be fixed for any given species. In LimuluspH-pN was essentially the same for in vivo samples, measured after the whole animal had been acclimated to different temperatures, as it was for in vitro samples in which the hemolymph was cooled or warmed anaerobically, suggesting that the CO2 content of the extracellular fluid is constant as the temperature changes. The PCO2 of the hemolymph is invariably lower in animals breathing water than in those breathing air. In the invertebrates, as in the vertebrates, manipulation of PCO2 and HCO3- is probably the major mechanism in the regulation of the relative alkalinity of the extracellular fluid.},

  abstract = {Concerns about the state of decline of the North American monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) have prompted their consideration for listing under the Endangered Species Act. Data suggest a substantial decline ({$>$} 80\%) in overwintering numbers for both eastern and western monarch populations. Making an accurate status assessment is difficult due to highly variable density estimates in the eastern monarch overwintering sites. We have developed a novel application of terrestrial LiDAR scanning (TLS) which creates a scene using millions of LASER-based distance measurements in the landscape. In this technology report we discuss the use of TLS and development of Subtractive Volume Estimation (SVE) methodology for estimating overwintering monarch butterfly populations. The principle proposition of the SVE method is to compare volumetric differences between two TLS surveys, a reference scan that records roosting monarch butterflies in their overwintering environment and a derivative scan, that records the same site without butterflies. Using paired long-range laser scanners, we collected data from four overwintering sites; two in California and two in central Mexico. To help estimate the number of butterflies, we developed an accurate 3D model of an individual monarch. To test the SVE method, we created digital 3D models of bare tree trunks and distal branches, based on laser scans at two sites and combined them with our monarch model to create virtual reference and derivative point clouds. To convert from volume to number of butterflies, we introduce a scaling factor, n, which represents the estimated volume occupied by one butterfly and a correction factor, f, which accounts for variation in clustering behavior and scanner position. While work is ongoing, we confirm that TLS combined with SVE is a suitable technique for surveying clusters of overwintering monarchs at overwintering sites in Mexico and the US.},

  abstract = {Adequately describing the dispersal mechanisms of a species is important for understanding and predicting its distribution dynamics in space and time. For wind-dispersed species, the transportation of airborne propagules is comparatively well studied, while the mechanisms triggering propagule release are poorly understood, especially for cryptogams. We investigated the effect of wind speed and turbulence on spore release in the moss Atrichum undulatum in a wind tunnel. Specifically, we measured the amount of spores released from sporophytes when exposed to different wind speeds, in high and low turbulence, using a particle counter. We also related spore release to variation in vibrations of the sporophyte and investigated how the vibrations were affected by wind speed, turbulence and sporophyte length (here including capsule, seta and the top part of the shoot). We show that in high turbulence, the amount of spores released increased with increasing wind speed, while in low turbulence, it did not, within the wind speed range 0.8–4.3 m s−1. However, there was a threshold in wind speed (˜2.5–3 m s−1) before large amounts of spores started to be released in turbulent flow, which coincided with incipient vibrations of the sporophyte. Thresholds in wind variation, rather than average wind speed, seemed to initiate sporophyte vibrations. The vibration threshold increased with decreasing sporophyte length. The deposition of spores near the source decreased with increasing wind variation during the time of their release, based on simulated spore deposition from another study of moss dispersal. Synthesis. We suggest that vibration of moss sporophytes is an important mechanism to regulate spore release and that turbulence and sporophyte length regulate the onset of sporophyte vibration. Spore release thresholds affect dispersal distances and have implications for our understanding and predictions of species distribution patterns, population dynamics and persistence. The mechanisms of this phase of the dispersal process are also important to explore for other species, as there may be a substantial variation depending on the species' different traits.},

Here we combine behavioural experiments of Schistocephalus solidus infected sticklebacks with individual-based simulations to understand how parasitism affects individual movement ability and thereby shapes social interaction patterns. High-resolution tracking revealed that infected fish swam, accelerated, and turned more slowly than did non-infected fish, and tended to be more predictable in their movements. Importantly, the strength of these effects increased with increasing parasite load (proportion of body weight), with more heavily infected fish showing larger changes and impairments in behaviour. When grouped, pairs of infected fish moved more slowly, were less cohesive, less aligned, and less temporally coordinated than non-infected pairs, and mixed pairs were primarily led by the non-infected fish. These social patterns also emerged in simulations of self-organised groups composed of individuals differing similarly in speed and turning tendency, suggesting infection-induced changes in mobility and manoeuvrability may drive collective outcomes. Together, our results demonstrate how infection with a complex life-cycle parasite affects the movement ability of individuals and how this in turn shapes social interaction patterns, providing important mechanistic insights into the effects of parasites on host movement dynamics.},

  abstract = {Parasites affect host behavior in several ways. They can alter activity, microhabitats or both. For trophically transmitted parasites (the focus of our study), decreased activity might impair the ability of hosts to respond to final-host predators, and increased activity and altered microhabitat choice might increase contact rates between hosts and final-host predators. In an analysis of trophically transmitted parasites, more parasite groups altered activity than altered microhabitat choice. Parasites that infected vertebrates were more likely to impair the host’s reaction to predators, whereas parasites that infected invertebrates were more likely to increase the host’s contact with predators. The site of infection might affect how parasites manipulate their hosts. For instance, parasites in the central nervous system seem particularly suited to manipulating host behavior. Manipulative parasites commonly occupy the body cavity, muscles and central nervous systems of their hosts. Acanthocephalans in the data set differed from other taxa in that they occurred exclusively in the body cavity of invertebrates. In addition, they were more likely to alter microhabitat choice than activity. Parasites in the body cavity (across parasite types) were more likely to be associated with increased host contact with predators. Parasites can manipulate the host through energetic drain, but most parasites use more sophisticated means. For instance, parasites target four physiological systems that shape behavior in both invertebrates and vertebrates: neural, endocrine, neuromodulatory and immunomodulatory. The interconnections between these systems make it difficult to isolate specific mechanisms of host behavioral manipulation.},

Yet, in the proximity of cave entrances (twilight zones), patterns of sunlight and darkness can be detected within the 24-hour day–night cycle. In parallel, changes in the abiotic and biotic conditions are expected; however, these patterns have been rarely explored in animal communities dwelling in the twilight zone. We performed a biological investigation in a small abandoned mine in the Western Alps, monitoring it once per season, both during the day and at night. At each survey, we collected data on the spatial distribution of the resident species, their activity patterns, and the main microclimatic parameters. We observed significant daily variations in the environmental conditions during winter and spring, namely higher temperature, relative humidity and availability of trophic resources at night. In conjunction with these disparate nocturnal conditions, the abundance of troglophile species was also higher, as well as the activity patterns of one of the most frequent species inhabiting the entrance area – the orb-weaver spider Meta menardi. We further documented temporal changes in the composition of the parietal community, due to species using the mine as a diurnal, nocturnal or overwintering shelter. Overall, our results suggest that the communities of the twilight zone are not temporally stable and we highlight the importance of taking into account not only their seasonal, but also their daily variations.},

  abstract = {Monarch butterflies from eastern North America migrate each fall to high altitude habitats in central Mexico and must avoid freezing, desiccation, heat stress, and predation while drawing on unrenewable lipid reserves for at least 90 d. Survival involves a heat—gaining morphology and behaviors in which thermoregulation plays a central role. Heat production by shivering permits raising of thoracic temperatures sufficiently for the butterflies to crawl up vegetation to sun—bask where they warm rapidly to flight threshold (°12.7°—16.0°C). Shivering and basking can also achieve or maintain flight temperature during partly cloudly weather. Both behaviors delay the decline of thoracic temperatures below flight threshold and consequent thermal trapping either on the ground beneath clusters of other monarchs, or while the butterflies are at water or nectar sources. The monarch thus is the first butterfly in which shivering has been shown to be of major ecological importance. At the other end of the thermal spectrum, basking in the intense insolation at this lattitude causes rapid warming at ambient temperatures as low as 9°. To avoid overheating and rapid depletion, the butterflies adopt sum—minimizing postures or fly out of insolated clusters and glide above the colony, losing heat to the cold ambient. Calculations suggest that a large proportion of the butterfies dies from depleting lipid stores. Maintenance of low body temperatures to conseve lipids is one of the major reasons why migrant monarchs select these high mountain forest as their overwinterin habitat.},

However, for many of the earth's most biodiverse and abundant organisms, including terrestrial arthropods, these interactions are difficult or impossible to observe directly with traditional approaches. Based on previous theory, it is likely that predator–prey interactions for these organisms are shaped by a combination of predator traits, including body size and species-specific hunting strategies. In this study, we combined diet DNA metabarcoding data of 173 individual invertebrate predators from nine species (a total of 305 individual predator–prey interactions) with an extensive community body size data set of a well-described invertebrate community to explore how predator traits and identity shape interactions. We found that (1) mean size of prey families in the field usually scaled with predator size, with species-specific variation to a general size-scaling relationship (exceptions likely indicating scavenging or feeding on smaller life stages). We also found that (2) although predator hunting traits, including web and venom use, are thought to shape predator–prey interaction outcomes, predator identity more strongly influenced our indirect measure of the relative size of predators and prey (predator:prey size ratios) than either of these hunting traits. Our findings indicate that predator body size and species identity are important in shaping trophic interactions in invertebrate food webs and could help predict how anthropogenic biodiversity change will influence terrestrial invertebrates, the earth's most diverse animal taxonomic group.},

  abstract = {Understanding and predicting complex biological systems are best accomplished through the synthesis and integration of information across relevant spatial, temporal and thematic scales. We propose that mechanistic transport models, which integrate atmospheric turbulence with information on relevant biological attributes, can effectively incorporate key elements of aerial transport processes at scales ranging from a few centimetres and fractions of seconds, to hundreds of kilometres and decades. This capability of mechanistic models is critically important for modelling the flow of organisms through the atmosphere because diverse aerial transport processes — such as pathogen spread, seed dispersal, spider ballooning and bird migration — are sensitive to the details of small-scale short-term turbulent deviations from the mean airflow. At the same time, all these processes are strongly influenced by the typical larger-scale variation in landscape structure, through its effects on wind flow patterns. We therefore highlight the useful coupling of detailed atmospheric models such as large eddy simulations (LES), which can provide a high-resolution description of turbulent airflow, with regional atmospheric models, which can capture the effects of landscape heterogeneity at various scales. Further progress in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) will enable rigorous exploration of transport processes in heterogeneous landscapes.},

In winter 2018–2019, the population plummeted even farther, to fewer than 30,000 monarchs, which represents a single year drop of 86\% and a drop of {$>$}99\% since the 1980s. The population may now be hovering at its quasi-extinction threshold. In this Perspectives piece, we: (1) Place the current status in context, (2) Highlight the most likely window during the annual life cycle when the population declined, (3) Review probable causes of long-term declines, and (4) Recommend steps that the public, policy makers, and land managers can take to recover western monarchs. The available studies reinforce the hypotheses that overwintering habitat loss and loss of central California breeding habitat, as well as pesticide use, are likely important contributors to the western monarch's long-term decline. The most limiting part of the migratory cycle appears to be concentrated during the overwintering stage and/or in early spring. If western monarchs are in fact entering an extinction vortex, they need extraordinary efforts—focused on the most vulnerable periods of the annual cycle— to save the migration. Critical short-term conservation priorities are to (1) Protect, manage and restore overwintering habitat, (2) Protect monarchs and their habitat from pesticides, (3) Restore breeding and migratory habitat in California, (4) Protect, manage, and restore summer breeding and fall migration monarch habitat throughout the western monarch's range, and (5) Fill research gaps to inform western monarch recovery strategies.},

For each of the 114 comparisons between infected and uninfected hosts that could be included, an estimate of the magnitude of the effect of parasites was calculated and standardized for the variability in the original data. Using these estimates, the meta-analysis then determined the overall magnitude and significance of the effect of parasites on host behaviour, and tested for consistency among the outcomes of different comparisons. Significant differences were found between helminth taxa, with nematodes having a greater effect on both host activity and microhabitat choice than other helminth parasites. The magnitude of the effect of parasites on host activity was similar whether the host was an invertebrate or a vertebrate, but the influence of parasites on host microhabitat choice was greater in vertebrates.

  abstract = {Entire tidal food webs rely on the presence and productivity of benthic invertebrates. These invertebrates recycle nutrients, decompose organic matter, and function as food for myriad species at higher trophic levels. The interactions between benthic invertebrate species also play an important role in shaping the ecological functioning of these ecosystems. Here, we used a deep-learning species distribution model to characterize the interspecific interactions occurring in an intertidal benthic invertebrate community while accounting for abiotic factors. The data include {$>$}30,000 samples collected between 2008 and 2020, over a spatial grid of more than 2400 km2 in the Wadden Sea. The benthic invertebrates in the Wadden Sea were shown to form a stable community where species engage in relatively few strong interactions in a larger network of weak interactions. This corroborates classical theory on stability–connectivity relations. We provide a stepping stone for species-specific analysis by showing that the numbers of interaction link to functional species traits. However, the biological interpretation of these links remains open. We conclude that rather than posing a catch-all solution for improving our understanding of benthic invertebrate communities, our approach provides a baseline interaction mapping tool and starting point for more targeted experiments to elucidate underlying mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Danaus plexippus L. (Linnaeus, 1758) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) is well-known and captivating migratory insect that cannot overwinter in temperate climates. Although common throughout North America, monarch butterfly populations appear to be declining widely in their geographically distinct areas. Rapid climatic change is posing a serious threat to monarch butterfly populations, especially the migratory groups in the east. This study assesses how several climate change scenarios will affect the global distribution of monarch butterflies. Using climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 model, we conducted projections for the near future (2021–2040) and far future (2041–2060, 2081–2100) under high (SSP5\_8.5) and low (SSP1\_2.6) emission scenarios. We estimated habitat gain, loss, and stability for D. plexippus. True Skill Statistic (TSS) and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) were used to assess the model’s performance. The results indicated that annual precipitation, land cover, and altitude (Alt) were the most influential factors affecting D. plexippus distribution. Potential habitat shifts were observed in Central Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America, with both gains and losses. These findings highlight the interconnected relationship between the climatic factors and distribution of migratory insects, emphasizing the need for targeted conservation efforts to mitigate climate change impacts on D. plexippus populations. Management strategies should prioritize habitat restoration, focus on overwintering site preservation, and implement adaptive management approaches. This research provides an evidence base for adaptive management to minimize climate change impacts on migratory insect populations.},

Migration allows the butterflies to escape freezing temperatures and dying host plants, and reduces infections with a virulent parasite. We discuss the multigenerational migration journey and its evolutionary history, and highlight the navigational mechanisms of migratory monarchs. Monarchs use a bidirectional time-compensated sun compass for orientation, which is based on a time-compensating circadian clock that resides in the antennae, and which has a distinctive molecular mechanism. Migrants can also use a light-dependent inclination magnetic compass for orientation under overcast conditions. Additional environmental features, e.g., atmospheric conditions, geologic barriers, and social interactions, likely augment navigation. The publication of the monarch genome and the development of gene-editing strategies have enabled the dissection of the genetic and neurobiological basis of the migration. The monarch butterfly has emerged as an excellent system to study the ecological, neural, and genetic basis of long-distance animal migration.},

  abstract = {Many small invertebrates inhabit the shallow subtidal zone and some of them emerge at times into the water column. The daily timing of their emergence is affected by the day/night and tidal cycles, and shows various patterns of synchrony with these cyclical factors, depending on the species. To detect possible regional differences in their emergence patterns, sampling was carried out at four locations in Japan: a boreal sea (Akkeshi), a temperate sea (Sugashima), an inland sea (Ushimado) and a subtropical sea (Iriomote-jima). The emergence patterns of major taxa were examined by visual inspection and by two statistical methods (periodogram and autocorrelogram). The composition of the taxa collected by the pump system, mostly crustaceans, was similar in each location. The number of ‘taxa’ that emerged revealed a day/night rhythm in every location. This characteristic was clearest at Iriomote-jima and least clear at Sugashima. The daily fluctuation in the number of individuals in each taxon varied widely, from very clearly nocturnal to weakly diurnal patterns. In Iriomote-jima, the major taxa all showed well-demarcated nocturnal patterns, so these patterns were classified as either level N2 or N3 with regard to the degree of synchrony with the day/night cycle. With regard to the synchrony with the tide, the majority of patterns in all locations showed a ‘double-tidal interval’. Many patterns were slightly modified by the tidal cycle. These patterns were classified as level T1 or T2 with regard to the degree of synchrony with the tidal cycle. The synchrony with the tide was comparatively strong at Ushimado. The synchrony with day/night and tidal cycles varied even within the same species or closely related species. In benthic invertebrates, hiding or resting in the bottom substrates and swimming in the water column would occur alternatively. In planktonic animals, aggregation near the bottom and dispersal in the water column would occur alternatively. The daily timing of such activities may be synchronized with the day/night and tidal cycles to various degrees among species or populations, resulting in a wide variety of emergence patterns in subtidal small invertebrates. This type of behavior is not ‘daily (diel) vertical migration’; it should rather be called ‘daily emergence/dispersal’. Strong winds, rough waves and unknown seasonal factors would also affect emergence patterns. Furthermore, the transparency of the seawater may also strongly affect these patterns. Nocturnal patterns may be an adaptation to avoid vulnerability to sighted predators. Variation of synchrony with the tide indicates that by definition, the tidal rhythm can only be distinguished from the day/night rhythm. Hence, the daily patterns that are weakly modified by the tides (levels T1 and T2) should be called the tidal rhythms. As the period of such rhythms cannot be determined exactly by using statistical methods, lengthy field investigations and visual inspection of each pattern is essential to assess the influence of tides.},

  abstract = {Migratory species are expected to demonstrate habitat selection that occurs at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Western monarch butterflies migrate seasonally to overwintering groves at geographically predictable locations along the coast of California. To date, overwintering habitat selection by western monarch butterflies has primarily been studied assuming the microclimate hypothesis. Specifically, that microclimate habitat selection occurs when monarchs form dense overwintering aggregations in overwintering groves. However, western monarch butterflies are migratory; thus, previous habitat selection studies could have commingled selection at different scales into a single local scale in the site of aggregation. Therefore, we explore monarch overwintering habitat selection to determine whether an explicit spatial framework is necessary. We studied nine groves on the coast of California, and at each we collected temperature, humidity, and light data from grove edges, grove interiors, and aggregation locations for several weeks during the overwintering season. We tested the hypothesis that monarchs aggregate in locations in groves that have a unique microclimate that is consistently selected across groves (the microclimate hypothesis). We find no evidence supporting the hypothesis that aggregation locations have a unique microclimate that differs significantly from that of other locations inside the grove or that aggregation locations are uniform in their microclimatic attributes across overwintering groves. Rather, we find that microclimatic attributes in aggregation locations vary spatially with latitude, and that aggregation conditions exist in a large portion of each grove. We conclude that it will be necessary to consider spatial effects when studying or managing western monarch butterfly overwintering habitats, and that interpretations of habitat selection to date likely commingle habitat selection on the local and geographical scales.},
  annotation = {This is a critical paper to my thesis, and in many ways, my master's is the sequel to this project. It investigated the "microclimate hypothesis" directly and challenges long held understanding of how monarchs select overwintering habitat. In particular, they did not find any compelling evidence that there are "special" pockets of suitable habitat within groves (e.g. where aggregations occur), and instead found temperature, humidity, and ligth conditions to be fairly consistent. They also found that each site measured was significiantly different than the others, suggesting that there is more flexibility in suitable conditions than previously thought. This study, however, did not address wind protection, thought to be a critical factor in the microclimate model, and offers many sections that lend justification to my project directly.},

Snail species that are able to cope with such climatic conditions are thus expected to having developed multifaceted strategies and mechanisms to ensure their survival and reproduction under heat and desiccation stress. This review paper aims to provide an integrative overview of the numerous adaptation strategies terrestrial snails have evolved to persist in hot and dry environments as well as their mutual interconnections and feedbacks, but also to outline research gaps and questions that remained unanswered. We extracted relevant information from more than 140 publications in order to show how biochemical, cellular, physiological, morphological, ecological, thermodynamic, and evolutionary parameters contribute to provide an overall picture of this classical example in stress ecology. These mechanisms range from behavioral and metabolic adaptations, including estivation, to the induction of chaperones and antioxidant enzymes, mucocyte and digestive gland cell responses and the modification and frequency of morphological features, particularly shell pigmentation. In this context, thermodynamic constraints call for processes of complex adaptation at varying levels of biological organization that are mutually interwoven. We were able to assemble extensive, mostly narrowly focused information from the literature into a web of network parameters, showing that future work on this subject requires multicausal thinking to account for the complexity of relationships involved in snails' adaptation to insolation, heat, and drought.},

  abstract = {In arid/semi-arid ecosystems, biological resources, such as water, soil nutrients, and plant biomass, typically go through periods of high and low abundance. Short periods of high resource abundance are usually triggered by rainfall events, which, despite of the overall scarcity of rain, can saturate the resource demand of some biological processes for a time. This review develops the idea that there exists a hierarchy of soil moisture pulse events with a corresponding hierarchy of ecological responses, such that small pulses only trigger a small number of relatively minor ecological events, and larger pulses trigger a more inclusive set and some larger ecological events. This framework hinges on the observation that many biological state changes, where organisms transition from a state of lower to higher physiological activity, require a minimal triggering event size. Response thresholds are often determined by the ability of organisms to utilize soil moisture pulses of different infiltration depth or duration. For example, brief, shallow pulses can only affect surface dwelling organisms with fast response times and high tolerance for low resource levels, such as some species of the soil micro-fauna and -flora, while it takes more water and deeper infiltration to affect the physiology, growth or reproduction of higher plants. This review first discusses how precipitation, climate and site factors translate into soil moisture pulses of varying magnitude and duration. Next, the idea of the response hierarchy for ecosystem processes is developed, followed by an exploration of the possible evolutionary background for the existence of response thresholds to resource pulses. The review concludes with an outlook on global change: does the hierarchical view of precipitation effects in ecosystems provide new perspectives on the future of arid/semiarid lands?},

BIOLOG EcoPlates and 16S rDNA sequencing (Illumina) were used to assess the microbial community’s physiological profile and the bacterial community’s structure, respectively. The bacterial abundance (estimated by 16S rDNA qPCR) did not change. Most of the conditions led to an increase in microbial activity and a decrease in diversity. The structure of the bacterial community was particularly affected by higher air temperatures (20–30 °C, without E. crypticus) and floods (with E. crypticus). Effects were observed at the class, genera and OTU levels. The presence of invertebrates mostly resulted in the attenuation of the observed effects, highlighting the importance of considering microbiome–invertebrate interactions.

  abstract = {A major conservation concern is whether population size and other ecological variables change linearly with habitat loss, or whether they suddenly decline more rapidly below a “critical threshold” level of habitat. The most commonly discussed explanation for critical threshold responses to habitat loss focus on habitat configuration. As habitat loss progresses, the remaining habitat is increasingly fragmented or the fragments are increasingly isolated, which may compound the effects of habitat loss. In this review we also explore other possible explanations for apparently nonlinear relationships between habitat loss and ecological responses, including Allee effects and time lags, and point out that some ecological variables will inherently respond nonlinearly to habitat loss even in the absence of compounding factors. In the literature, both linear and nonlinear ecological responses to habitat loss are evident among simulation and empirical studies, although the presence and value of critical thresholds is influenced by characteristics of the species (e.g. dispersal, reproduction, area/edge sensitivity) and landscape (e.g. fragmentation, matrix quality, rate of change). With enough empirical support, such trends could be useful for making important predictions about species' responses to habitat loss, to guide future research on the underlying causes of critical thresholds, and to make better informed management decisions. Some have seen critical thresholds as a means of identifying conservation targets for habitat retention. We argue that in many cases this may be misguided, and that the meaning (and utility) of a critical threshold must be interpreted carefully and in relation to the response variable and management goal. Despite recent interest in critical threshold responses to habitat loss, most studies have not used any formal statistical methods to identify their presence or value. Methods that have been used include model comparisons using Akaike information criterion (AIC) or t-tests, and significance testing for changes in slope or for polynomial effects. The judicious use of statistics to help determine the shape of ecological relationships would permit greater objectivity and more comparability among studies.},

  abstract = {The influence of predation on rocky intertidal community structure has long emphasized the importance of indirect interactions. Most efforts in this area have focused on the density-mediated, or lethal effects, of predators on prey density. Recently, there has been growing interest in trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs): the presence of a predator in the environment influences the interaction between two other species (prey and their resource) by altering a trait of the prey species. For example, waterborne cues released by predators can cause changes in prey species behavior, such as feeding rates, thereby altering the impact of the prey species on their resources. Thus, TMIIs represent the nonlethal effects of predators that contrast with the more traditional emphasis on lethal indirect effects. Marine ecologists are just beginning to explore the role of TMIIs in their systems. We examined whether risk cues released by a ubiquitous crab predator (Carcinus maenas) influence the abundance of two dominant species in the rocky intertidal zone (barnacles [Semibalanus balanoides] and fucoid algae [Ascophyllum nodosum]) by altering the behavior of two of its snail prey (Nucella lapillus and Littorina littorea). We found that the presence of green crab risk cues can have strong cascading indirect effects on the abundance of barnacles and fucoid algae. N. lapillus exposed to risk cues consumed up to 29\% fewer barnacles compared to conspecifics feeding in the absence of risk cues, whereas L. littorea exposed to risk cues consumed 459\% fewer fucoids compared to conspecifics feeding in the absence of risk cues. These cascading interactions appear to reflect suppression of snail feeding by predator risk cues. In both food chains, snails exhibited more refuge-seeking behavior and grew less in the presence of risk cues. Our experiments suggest that TMIIs may have an important and underappreciated influence on species interactions that shape community dynamics on rocky intertidal shores. Corresponding Editor: P. T.

  abstract = {Despite an upsurge of interest in spatial interactions between communities and in the impact of dispersal on ecological and evolutionary processes, dispersal patterns and dynamics in natural metacommunities remain poorly understood. Although passive aerial dispersal of freshwater invertebrates is generally accepted, the frequency and relative importance of wind as a vector is still subject of considerable debate. We assessed the importance of wind dispersal in an invertebrate metacommunity in a cluster of 36 temporary rock pools on an isolated mountaintop in South Africa. Wind dispersal was quantified every four days using nine windsocks (about 1.5 m above rock base), placed in the field during one month. Distance to the nearest pool varied from 2 up to 16 m. Wind direction and speed were monitored for the entire period. About 850 propagules (mostly resting eggs) of 17 taxa were captured. The presence of water in the pools (level of exposure of the dormant propagule bank) and the dominant wind direction were the key factors affecting the yield. Wind speed was much less important. Our results suggest that wind dispersal of propagules from temporary aquatic systems is more frequent than previously thought. This may stabilise the metacommunity by mediating gene flow among populations and facilitating rapid (re)colonisation of patches. On the other hand, wind erosion of the dormant propagule bank may lead to egg bank depletion and local extinction. The measured frequent wind dispersal most likely fuels strong species sorting processes ultimately shaping the structure of the local communities as observed in an earlier study. To elucidate the link between local dispersal rates and their contribution to long range dispersal is a major challenge for future research on aerial dispersal of aquatic invertebrates.},

  abstract = {Wind, a major source of environmental noise, forces invertebrates that communicate with plant-borne vibrations to adjust their signaling when communicating in windy conditions. However, the strategies that animals use to reduce the impact of wind noise on communication are not well studied. We investigated the effects of wind on the production of tremulatory signals in the neotropical katydid Copiphora brevirostris. First, we recorded katydid signaling activity and natural wind variation in the field. Additionally, we exposed katydid couples during their most active signaling time period to artificial wind of different levels, and we recorded the number of tremulations produced by the males. We found that wind levels are at their lowest between 2:00 and 5:00 in the morning, which coincides with peak signaling period for male katydids. Furthermore, we found that males produce significantly fewer tremulations when exposed to wind rather than acoustic noise or silence. Wind velocity significantly affected the number of tremulations produced during the wind treatment, with fewer tremulations produced with higher wind velocities. Our results show that katydids can time their vibratory signaling both in the short- and long-term to favorable sensory conditions, either through behavioral flexibility in response to short-term fluctuations in wind or as a result of an evolutionary process in response to predictable periods of low-wind conditions.},

  abstract = {1. Previous work has suggested that species diversity in resource-limited insect communities on patchy resources is maintained by spatial aggregation, not by resource partitioning. The most comprehensive test of this claim to date was by Shorrocks \& Sevenster (1995), but some of their datasets included only a few resource types, which reduces the likelihood of finding a strong effect of resource partitioning. Also, methods of analysis have since been refined, e.g. to account for patch size. 2. We collected 733 mushroom samples belonging to 66 taxa in a Dutch woodland area. From these mushrooms, 38,891 insects were reared, belonging to 60 taxa of Diptera and Hymenoptera. Drosophilid species and their parasitoids were identified to the species level; other taxa to the family level. We argue that the community is resource limited. 3. Generally, the insects have fairly narrow diets, including only a few of the available mushroom species. The degree of niche overlap varies widely in this community. 4. Within single resource types, co-existence can be explained by intra-specific aggregation over patches alone, in accordance with previous studies. 5. This conclusion remains unchanged for the mycophagous community as a whole: intra-specific aggregation of competitors is a sufficient and necessary mechanism for co-existence in this diverse community, while resource partitioning does not contribute detectably to species diversity. This is the first time that this pattern has been demonstrated in a dataset involving such a large number of resource types. 6. Our conclusions are strongly supported by data manipulations in which we removed or intensified the effect of resource partitioning and spatial aggregation. 7. We argue that this community may be close to saturation, but we emphasize that saturation is a gradual phenomenon in patchy systems. 8. Since differential use of resource types does not reduce competitive interactions among the insects, it seems unlikely that inter-specific competition constitutes the selective pressure favouring specialization.},

  abstract = {Critical thresholds are transition ranges across which small changes in spatial pattern produce abrupt shifts in ecological responses. Habitat fragmentation provides a familiar example of a critical threshold. As the landscape becomes dissected into smaller parcels of habitat, landscape connectivity–the functional linkage among habitat patches–may suddenly become disrupted, which may have important consequences for the distribution and persistence of populations. Landscape connectivity depends not only on the abundance and spatial patterning of habitat, but also on the habitat specificity and dispersal abilities of species. Habitat specialists with limited dispersal capabilities presumably have a much lower threshold to habitat fragmentation than highly vagile species, which may perceive the landscape as functionally connected across a greater range of fragmentation severity. To determine where threshold effects in species' responses to landscape structure are likely to occur, we developed a simulation model modified from percolation theory. Our simulations predicted the distributional patterns of populations in different landscape mosaics, which we tested empirically using two grasshopper species (Orthoptera: Acrididae) that occur in the shortgrass prairie of north—central Colorado. Increasing degree of habitat specialization and dispersal range of a species enhanced the level of aggregation–the degree of clumping exhibited by the population–in our simulations. The landscape threshold at which populations became aggregated was affected by dispersal range for habitat generalists, but not for habitat specialists. Habitat specialists exhibited aggregated populations when preferred habitat occupied {$<$}40\% of the landscape. Habitat generalists with good dispersal abilities occurred as aggregated populations when {$<$}35\% of the landscape contained suitable habitat; habitat generalists with limited dispersal only formed patchy distributions when the preferred habitat was a minor (20\%) proportion of the habitat. In field tests, a large species of grasshopper (Xanthippus corallipes Haldeman) exhibited reduced rates of travel in two microhabitats that together comprised 35\% of a grassland mosaic; a smaller species (Psoloessa delicatula Scudder) had the highest residence time in a rare microhabitat that occurred in only 8\% of the landscape. On the basis of our simulation results, we predicted that the large species would be patchily distributed because the abundance of its associated habitat is at the critical threshold. The small species should be unable to aggregate, given the rarity of habitat for which it has an affinity, and thus should be randomly distributed across the landscape. The distribution of these two species in this grassland mosaic matched the predictions from our simulations. By providing quantitative predictions of threshold effects, this modelling approach may prove useful in the formulation of conservation strategies and assessment of land—use changes on species' distributional patterns and persistence.},

Phylogenetic trees have demonstrated multiple gains and loss of ant-attendance in the course of aphid-ant interactions, implying that mutualisms easily form and dissolve. Several studies have reported the factors that influence the formation and maintenance of aphid-ant interactions. Examples include the physiological costs of ant attendance, competition for mutualistic ants, ant predation on aphids, the influence of host plants, and parasitoid wasps. Recent physiological techniques have also revealed the chemical component of aphid-ant mutualisms. The honeydew of ant-attended aphids contains melezitose (a trisaccharide), which has an important role in aphid-ant interactions. Studies of cuticular hydrocarbons on aphids and ants have clarified the underlying mechanisms of ant predation on aphids. Attending ants also reduce aphid dispersal ability, causing the formation of fragmented aphid populations with low genetic diversity in each population. The reduced aphid dispersal could be partly explained by higher wing loading and reduction of flight apparatus due to ant attendance. Whether ant attendance is associated with the range of host plants of aphids or genetic variation in microorganism in aphids remain to be explored.},
