  abstract = {Abstract. 1. At their high-altitude overwintering sites in Mexico, monarch butterflies frequently are subjected to sub-zero°C temperatures during December-March. Although monarchs have moderate supercooling ability, two ecological factors strongly influence their capacity to resist freezing: wetting and exposure to the clear night sky. 2. As shown in Fig. 2, 50\% of a population of butterflies with water on their body surfaces freeze at warmer sub-zero temperatures (-4.2°C) compared to butterflies with no water on their bodies (-7.7°C). 100\% mortality occurs, respectively, at −7.7°C and −15°C. 3. Comparative measurements of rainfall within a large overwintering colony in Mexico indicated that the intact canopy acts as an umbrella that reduces butterfly wetting during winter storms. 4. Variable experimental exposure of butterflies to the clear night sky indicated that openings in the forest canopy increases radiational cooling and causes monarch body temperatures to drop as much as 4°C below ambient air temperature. Monarchs under dense cover had body temperatures approximately the same as the ambient air temperature, but more exposed individuals had body temperatures below ambient in direct proportion to the degree of exposure. Consequently, forest thinning increases the probability that the butterflies will freeze to death. 5. Whereas both wetting and exposure are increased by disturbance of the forest canopy, the interaction of these two factors exacerbates freezing mortality during winter storms: 50\% of dry and unexposed butterflies froze at −8°C, whereas wetted and fully exposed butterflies froze at only −0.5°C. 6. Butterflies inside and on the bottom of the fir bough clusters are better protected from wetting than those on the outside. This supports the hypothesis that the structure of the butterfly clusters has evolved through individual selection to avoid wetting. 7. The data strongly reinforce previous evidence that forest thinning should be totally prevented within and adjacent to the overwintering sites in order to minimize both wetting and exposure of the butterflies that synergistically increase winter mortality at the overwintering sites in Mexico.},

  abstract = {Two congeneric damselfly species, Enallagma traviatum and E. aspersum, dominate the littoral macroinvertebrates of Bays Mountain Lake and of the adjacent fish-free Ecology Pond, respectively (northeastern Tennessee, USA). Extending previous experimental studies, we test seven hypotheses concerning the role of fish (bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus) and larvaldragonfly (Anax junius) predation, competitive effects on damselflies, and the interaction between competition and predation, in determining invertebrate dominance in these communities. Three types of experiments were conducted: an enclosure experiment within Ecology Pond, an outdoor replicated tub experiment, and a laboratory behavior experiment. The in-situ enclosure experiment showed that E. traviatum larvae were more susceptible to Anax predation than were E. aspersum larvae; a tendency toward greater vulnerability to fish of E. aspersum compared with E. traviatum was not statistically significant. The outdoor tub experiment confirmed both of these trends with statistically significant results. In the tubs, both predators inhibited feeding of both zygopterans (as indicated by reduced fecal mass), particularly for E. aspersum in the presence of fish. This effect appears to have been primarily indirect, mediated through exploitation of the zooplankton. We also detected competitive effects of E. traviatum on E. aspersum: E. traviatum reduced the emergence and increased the exposure above the substrate of E. aspersum. In the absence of predators, E. traviatum inhibited feeding of E. aspersum via interference. In the laboratory behavior experiment, predators inhibited crawling by E. aspersum. E. aspersum was more exposed than was E. traviatum; it swam and crawled more than did E. traviatum, considerably increasing these movements at night. Over all, E. traviatum consistently appeared to be the more cryptic of the two species, and E. aspersum appeared to be much more active. Our results suggest an explanation for the clear difference in structure between communities like Bays Mountain Lake and Ecology Pond: predaceous fish eliminate large invertebrate predators and shift the community toward cryptic forms at relatively low densities, reflecting the effects of both predation and exploitation competition. In the absence of fish, large invertebrate predators are less able to deplete littoral invertebrates but may favor the more active forms, perhaps because these are better able to avoid invertebrate predators.},

It involves a typical and unique pre-dispersal ‘tiptoe’ behaviour that can easily be observed under laboratory conditions. Hypotheses: Is the ballooning behaviour of a saltmarsh-inhabiting spider heritable? Do heritability estimates differ under two different environmental conditions (wind velocity)? Organism: Second-instar offspring from Pardosa purbeckensis (Lycosidae; Araneae). Site of experiments: Parents were collected in a large and a small salt marsh. Offspring were tested for behavioural variation under standardized laboratory experiments. Methods: Ballooning motivation (tiptoe behaviour) was assessed at two wind velocities in wind tunnels. We conducted a quantitative (half-sib) genetic analysis of ballooning motivation and applied threshold models to estimate heritabilities under both wind conditions. Results: Heritability estimates were 0.17 (standard error = 0.07) at low wind velocities and 0.42 (standard error = 0.21) at high wind velocities. Because of the absence of a genetic correlation among the two wind environments, independent selection on dispersal motivation under different wind velocities must be prevalent.},

A conservative calculation of mortality through the 135 day overwintering season was 2.034 million butterflies, or about 9\% of the colony. The birds preyed selectively upon male butterflies, possibly because of a difference in fat content, or possibly because females contain higher concentrations and larger amounts of cardenolide or other defensive chemicals. The risk to individual monarchs of being killed was much greater on the colony periphery and in thinned areas of the forest. Bird predation thus is sufficient to have played a major role in shaping the evolution of the monarch's overwintering and aggregation behavior.},

  abstract = {Understanding the factors associated with declines of at-risk species is an important first step in setting management and recovery targets. This step can be challenging when multiple aspects of climate and land use are changing simultaneously, and any or all could be contributing to population declines. We analyzed population trends of monarch butterflies in western North America in relation to likely environmental drivers. Unlike the larger eastern monarch population, past analyses of western monarchs have only evaluated the importance of climate (i.e., not land use) factors as drivers of abundance. We used partial least squares regression (PLSR) to evaluate the potential importance of changes in land use and climate variables. Trends in western monarch abundance were more strongly associated with land use variables than climate variables. Conclusions about importance of climate and land use variables were robust to changes in PLSR model structure. However, individual variables were too collinear to unambiguously separate their effects. We compared these conclusions to the more widely used technique of multiple regression, followed by multi-model inference (MRMI). Na€ıve interpretation of MRMI results could be misleading, if collinearity were not taken into account. MRMI was also highly sensitive to variation in model construction. Our results suggest a two-pronged approach to monarch conservation, specifically, starting efforts now to restore habitat, while also using experiments to more clearly delineate separate effects of climate and land use factors. They also demonstrate the utility of PLSR, a technique that is growing in use but is still relatively under-appreciated in conservation biology.},

Grove locations are known from recent and historical surveys and a long-term citizen science database. The climatic niche model performs well, predicting that overwintering habitat is most likely to occur along the coast and at low elevations, as shown by empirical data. We then use climatic variables in conjunction with climate change scenarios to model the future location of overwintering habitat, and find a substantial shift in the predicted distribution. Under a plausible scenario, the probability of occurrence of overwintering habitat directly reflects elevation, with coastal regions having a reduced probability relative to today, and higher elevation sites increasing in probability. Under a more extreme scenario, high probability sites are only located along ridgelines and in mountaintop regions of the county. This predicted shift in distribution is likely to have management implications, as sites that currently lack monarchs may become critical to conservation in the future. Our results suggest that estimating the size of the western overwintering population in the future will be problematic, unless annual counts compensate for a shift in the distribution and a potential change in the number and location of occupied sites.},

  abstract = {Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) of the western United States are famous for their annual fall migration from inland and northern summer breeding ranges to their coastal overwintering grounds in California. Despite their notoriety, there is still a limited understanding around their overwintering biology, and apparent habitat selection that results in their coastal distribution of overwintering grounds spanning from Mendocino County to Baja California. As ectotherms, however, temperature and climate play a large role in how they interact with the ecosystems of California, from migration to overwintering. As a population of special concern that is currently under review for listing, understanding the relationships between monarchs and the habitat they select will be imperative to well-informed conservation strategies. In Chapter 1, we review existing literature and summarize how temperature influences survivorship of various life stages of monarch butterflies (egg, larva/pupa, adult, and overwintering adult). We also review the terminology associated with dormancy, including diapause and quiescence. We focus on temperature as a determinant of egg development together and separately from the transition out of diapause. We find that monarch butterfly ecophysiology is sufficiently well understood to argue that western monarchs experience a true diapause that likely ends in late fall (December) rather than in late winter (February) and is likely followed by a late winter quiescence period. This review also provides a comprehensive ecophysiological context for discussing the effects of climate and climate change on overwintering western monarch butterfly diapause and breeding behavior. Here, we review and compile available microclimate and landscape-level temperature data for overwintering grounds. Our heuristic analysis suggests that monarch butterflies in the west may be overwintering (in some sites and in some years) at the upper thermal threshold of egg development and release from dormancy. Ultimately, this review of literature and comparison to climatic data for overwintering groves provides a comprehensive physiological context to generate new hypotheses of regional effects of climate change on various life stages and reproductive productivity. In Chapter 2, we review the body of literature describing physical overwintering site characteristics commonly re-cited, and identify the level of empirical support provided for each. For several untested physical characteristics such as slope and aspect, we measure their values at overwintering groves and statistically compare them to randomly generated paired sites. Thereby we test for attribute selection at the level of the entire grove. Our results demonstrate that two untested, but frequently re-cited characteristics of overwintering groves (south-west facing aspect and non-ephemeral water), may just reflect common characteristics of coastal topography rather than preference or selection at the grove-scale. Our results support habitat selection for locations near the coast, at low elevations, and with gentle slopes. Thus, we further resolve habitat characteristics that are and are not selected by overwintering monarchs at this scale. In Chapter 3, we generated a hierarchical species distribution model (SDM) that identifies regions and habitat characteristics which influence migratory and overwintering monarchs. We evaluated population-wide climatic and local landscape-level predictors of migratory and overwintering habitat for western monarch butterflies using community-science presence data. The population-wide model output of suitability was integrated as an attribute into the local-scale  v model to generate hierarchically nested predictions for peak habitat suitability. The top climatic predictor at the population-wide scale was minimum temperature in December, with an 83.7\% contribution to the model. At the localized scale, the strongest predictor of presence (aside from the population-wide output) was percent cover for low and medium levels of development. Development had a strong positive association with overwintering monarch presence, which is counterintuitive. While the local-scale model results suggested peak habitat suitability coincided with the coastal zone of California, they also suggested an overfit to the urban development predictors. Overwintering sites were associated with the coastal zone, which is well-developed in California. It is unclear whether monarchs were truly selecting overwintering sites closer to human development; whether they are forced into those sites because they are the best available remaining locations for overwintering; or if detection of overwintering sites was biased closer to developed areas. Overall, climatic variables had the most predictive value, and systematic/randomized sampling for overwintering habitat outside of heavily populated zones may be necessary to discern the best predictors of peak habitat suitability.},

In both seasons, patterns of tree use were similar at both sites; fewer trees supported clustering individuals as the season progressed, even though population levels remained constant. Tree use was not random, and as few as 3\% of the available trees accounted for 97\% of the clustering. A method of describing the location of clusters on specific trees was developed. Roosting individuals were consistently found on the southern exposures of trees, and cluster locations varied neither diurnally nor seasonally. Microclimate variables such as solar radiation, temperature, and wind were not good predictors of clustering position on trees within sites.},

The surface activity of this beetle species was found to be correlated both with time of day and wind speed. Higher numbers were observed on the dune surface between 17:00–19:00 h when wind speeds were consistently higher than 9 m/s. Noise and vibrations in the dune sand were found to be highly dependent on wind speed. Wind blowing at speeds higher than 5 m/s lifts the surface sand grains and generates vibrations in the sand. The peak frequency of these vibrations is in the range of 700–1000 Hz. The vibrational amplitude at the peak frequency is on average 40 dB higher at those wind speeds when the beetles are active compared to lower wind speeds. The results indicate that wind is an important cue for these beetles and can be perceived by buried beetles through substrate vibrations.},

Benthologists publishing in J-NABS have contributed robustly to our overall knowledge of predation and herbivory but less so of other species interactions. Predators can limit the abundance of benthic prey and affect prey size or age structure, behavior, and morphology, and these effects can be transmitted through food webs and ecosystems. Herbivores can limit biomass of benthic algae, alter physiognomy, species composition and diversity, and stoichiometry, and exert strong indirect effects within food webs and nutrient cycles. Parasites can alter host behavior or morphology, but few studies have shown that lethal/sublethal effects of parasites on their hosts have population- or community-scale consequences. Fishes and macroinvertebrates occasionally experience competition, but the effect of competition on demographies and assemblages appears restricted to local scales, perhaps because competition can be modulated by many biotic (bioenergetic efficiency, parasitism, predation) and abiotic (floods, drought, resource distribution) factors. Positive interactions have been the least studied species interaction by benthologists, but interest is growing. Future study of population-scale positive interactions and nontraditional interactions at larger scales (e.g., riparian effects on benthic habitat stabilization, cross-system recruitment of different life stages) will improve our understanding of freshwater benthic ecosystems and their conservation. We urge benthologists to explore how populations evolve in response to biotic interactions embedded in benthic communities and to assess how these responses might redefine trophic and community structure and their emergent properties.},

Data suggest a substantial decline ({$>$} 80\%) in overwintering numbers for both eastern and western monarch populations. Making an accurate status assessment is difficult due to highly variable density estimates in the eastern monarch overwintering sites. We have developed a novel application of terrestrial LiDAR scanning (TLS) which creates a scene using millions of LASER-based distance measurements in the landscape. In this technology report we discuss the use of TLS and development of Subtractive Volume Estimation (SVE) methodology for estimating overwintering monarch butterfly populations. The principle proposition of the SVE method is to compare volumetric differences between two TLS surveys, a reference scan that records roosting monarch butterflies in their overwintering environment and a derivative scan, that records the same site without butterflies. Using paired long-range laser scanners, we collected data from four overwintering sites; two in California and two in central Mexico. To help estimate the number of butterflies, we developed an accurate 3D model of an individual monarch. To test the SVE method, we created digital 3D models of bare tree trunks and distal branches, based on laser scans at two sites and combined them with our monarch model to create virtual reference and derivative point clouds. To convert from volume to number of butterflies, we introduce a scaling factor, n, which represents the estimated volume occupied by one butterfly and a correction factor, f, which accounts for variation in clustering behavior and scanner position. While work is ongoing, we confirm that TLS combined with SVE is a suitable technique for surveying clusters of overwintering monarchs at overwintering sites in Mexico and the US.},

  abstract = {Adequately describing the dispersal mechanisms of a species is important for understanding and predicting its distribution dynamics in space and time. For wind-dispersed species, the transportation of airborne propagules is comparatively well studied, while the mechanisms triggering propagule release are poorly understood, especially for cryptogams. We investigated the effect of wind speed and turbulence on spore release in the moss Atrichum undulatum in a wind tunnel. Specifically, we measured the amount of spores released from sporophytes when exposed to different wind speeds, in high and low turbulence, using a particle counter. We also related spore release to variation in vibrations of the sporophyte and investigated how the vibrations were affected by wind speed, turbulence and sporophyte length (here including capsule, seta and the top part of the shoot). We show that in high turbulence, the amount of spores released increased with increasing wind speed, while in low turbulence, it did not, within the wind speed range 0.8–4.3 m s−1. However, there was a threshold in wind speed (˜2.5–3 m s−1) before large amounts of spores started to be released in turbulent flow, which coincided with incipient vibrations of the sporophyte. Thresholds in wind variation, rather than average wind speed, seemed to initiate sporophyte vibrations. The vibration threshold increased with decreasing sporophyte length. The deposition of spores near the source decreased with increasing wind variation during the time of their release, based on simulated spore deposition from another study of moss dispersal. Synthesis. We suggest that vibration of moss sporophytes is an important mechanism to regulate spore release and that turbulence and sporophyte length regulate the onset of sporophyte vibration. Spore release thresholds affect dispersal distances and have implications for our understanding and predictions of species distribution patterns, population dynamics and persistence. The mechanisms of this phase of the dispersal process are also important to explore for other species, as there may be a substantial variation depending on the species' different traits.},

  abstract = {Parasitism is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom. Although many fundamental aspects of host-parasite relationships have been unravelled, few studies have systematically investigated how parasites affect organismal movement. Here we combine behavioural experiments of Schistocephalus solidus infected sticklebacks with individual-based simulations to understand how parasitism affects individual movement ability and thereby shapes social interaction patterns. High-resolution tracking revealed that infected fish swam, accelerated, and turned more slowly than did non-infected fish, and tended to be more predictable in their movements. Importantly, the strength of these effects increased with increasing parasite load (proportion of body weight), with more heavily infected fish showing larger changes and impairments in behaviour. When grouped, pairs of infected fish moved more slowly, were less cohesive, less aligned, and less temporally coordinated than non-infected pairs, and mixed pairs were primarily led by the non-infected fish. These social patterns also emerged in simulations of self-organised groups composed of individuals differing similarly in speed and turning tendency, suggesting infection-induced changes in mobility and manoeuvrability may drive collective outcomes. Together, our results demonstrate how infection with a complex life-cycle parasite affects the movement ability of individuals and how this in turn shapes social interaction patterns, providing important mechanistic insights into the effects of parasites on host movement dynamics.},

  abstract = {Parasites affect host behavior in several ways. They can alter activity, microhabitats or both. For trophically transmitted parasites (the focus of our study), decreased activity might impair the ability of hosts to respond to final-host predators, and increased activity and altered microhabitat choice might increase contact rates between hosts and final-host predators. In an analysis of trophically transmitted parasites, more parasite groups altered activity than altered microhabitat choice. Parasites that infected vertebrates were more likely to impair the host’s reaction to predators, whereas parasites that infected invertebrates were more likely to increase the host’s contact with predators. The site of infection might affect how parasites manipulate their hosts. For instance, parasites in the central nervous system seem particularly suited to manipulating host behavior. Manipulative parasites commonly occupy the body cavity, muscles and central nervous systems of their hosts. Acanthocephalans in the data set differed from other taxa in that they occurred exclusively in the body cavity of invertebrates. In addition, they were more likely to alter microhabitat choice than activity. Parasites in the body cavity (across parasite types) were more likely to be associated with increased host contact with predators. Parasites can manipulate the host through energetic drain, but most parasites use more sophisticated means. For instance, parasites target four physiological systems that shape behavior in both invertebrates and vertebrates: neural, endocrine, neuromodulatory and immunomodulatory. The interconnections between these systems make it difficult to isolate specific mechanisms of host behavioral manipulation.},

  abstract = {Monarch butterflies from eastern North America migrate each fall to high altitude habitats in central Mexico and must avoid freezing, desiccation, heat stress, and predation while drawing on unrenewable lipid reserves for at least 90 d. Survival involves a heat—gaining morphology and behaviors in which thermoregulation plays a central role. Heat production by shivering permits raising of thoracic temperatures sufficiently for the butterflies to crawl up vegetation to sun—bask where they warm rapidly to flight threshold (°12.7°—16.0°C). Shivering and basking can also achieve or maintain flight temperature during partly cloudly weather. Both behaviors delay the decline of thoracic temperatures below flight threshold and consequent thermal trapping either on the ground beneath clusters of other monarchs, or while the butterflies are at water or nectar sources. The monarch thus is the first butterfly in which shivering has been shown to be of major ecological importance. At the other end of the thermal spectrum, basking in the intense insolation at this lattitude causes rapid warming at ambient temperatures as low as 9°. To avoid overheating and rapid depletion, the butterflies adopt sum—minimizing postures or fly out of insolated clusters and glide above the colony, losing heat to the cold ambient. Calculations suggest that a large proportion of the butterfies dies from depleting lipid stores. Maintenance of low body temperatures to conseve lipids is one of the major reasons why migrant monarchs select these high mountain forest as their overwinterin habitat.},

  abstract = {Predator–prey interactions shape ecosystems and can help maintain biodiversity. However, for many of the earth's most biodiverse and abundant organisms, including terrestrial arthropods, these interactions are difficult or impossible to observe directly with traditional approaches. Based on previous theory, it is likely that predator–prey interactions for these organisms are shaped by a combination of predator traits, including body size and species-specific hunting strategies. In this study, we combined diet DNA metabarcoding data of 173 individual invertebrate predators from nine species (a total of 305 individual predator–prey interactions) with an extensive community body size data set of a well-described invertebrate community to explore how predator traits and identity shape interactions. We found that (1) mean size of prey families in the field usually scaled with predator size, with species-specific variation to a general size-scaling relationship (exceptions likely indicating scavenging or feeding on smaller life stages). We also found that (2) although predator hunting traits, including web and venom use, are thought to shape predator–prey interaction outcomes, predator identity more strongly influenced our indirect measure of the relative size of predators and prey (predator:prey size ratios) than either of these hunting traits. Our findings indicate that predator body size and species identity are important in shaping trophic interactions in invertebrate food webs and could help predict how anthropogenic biodiversity change will influence terrestrial invertebrates, the earth's most diverse animal taxonomic group.},

  abstract = {Understanding and predicting complex biological systems are best accomplished through the synthesis and integration of information across relevant spatial, temporal and thematic scales. We propose that mechanistic transport models, which integrate atmospheric turbulence with information on relevant biological attributes, can effectively incorporate key elements of aerial transport processes at scales ranging from a few centimetres and fractions of seconds, to hundreds of kilometres and decades. This capability of mechanistic models is critically important for modelling the flow of organisms through the atmosphere because diverse aerial transport processes — such as pathogen spread, seed dispersal, spider ballooning and bird migration — are sensitive to the details of small-scale short-term turbulent deviations from the mean airflow. At the same time, all these processes are strongly influenced by the typical larger-scale variation in landscape structure, through its effects on wind flow patterns. We therefore highlight the useful coupling of detailed atmospheric models such as large eddy simulations (LES), which can provide a high-resolution description of turbulent airflow, with regional atmospheric models, which can capture the effects of landscape heterogeneity at various scales. Further progress in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) will enable rigorous exploration of transport processes in heterogeneous landscapes.},

In winter 2018–2019, the population plummeted even farther, to fewer than 30,000 monarchs, which represents a single year drop of 86\% and a drop of {$>$}99\% since the 1980s. The population may now be hovering at its quasi-extinction threshold. In this Perspectives piece, we: (1) Place the current status in context, (2) Highlight the most likely window during the annual life cycle when the population declined, (3) Review probable causes of long-term declines, and (4) Recommend steps that the public, policy makers, and land managers can take to recover western monarchs. The available studies reinforce the hypotheses that overwintering habitat loss and loss of central California breeding habitat, as well as pesticide use, are likely important contributors to the western monarch's long-term decline. The most limiting part of the migratory cycle appears to be concentrated during the overwintering stage and/or in early spring. If western monarchs are in fact entering an extinction vortex, they need extraordinary efforts—focused on the most vulnerable periods of the annual cycle— to save the migration. Critical short-term conservation priorities are to (1) Protect, manage and restore overwintering habitat, (2) Protect monarchs and their habitat from pesticides, (3) Restore breeding and migratory habitat in California, (4) Protect, manage, and restore summer breeding and fall migration monarch habitat throughout the western monarch's range, and (5) Fill research gaps to inform western monarch recovery strategies.},

For each of the 114 comparisons between infected and uninfected hosts that could be included, an estimate of the magnitude of the effect of parasites was calculated and standardized for the variability in the original data. Using these estimates, the meta-analysis then determined the overall magnitude and significance of the effect of parasites on host behaviour, and tested for consistency among the outcomes of different comparisons. Significant differences were found between helminth taxa, with nematodes having a greater effect on both host activity and microhabitat choice than other helminth parasites. The magnitude of the effect of parasites on host activity was similar whether the host was an invertebrate or a vertebrate, but the influence of parasites on host microhabitat choice was greater in vertebrates. Contrary to what had been expected, parasites that do not appear to benefit from changes in host behaviour had the greatest impact on host behaviour, although taxonomic biases may have affected this comparison. The meta-analysis has uncovered trends and raised several questions that should be addressed in future studies.},

These invertebrates recycle nutrients, decompose organic matter, and function as food for myriad species at higher trophic levels. The interactions between benthic invertebrate species also play an important role in shaping the ecological functioning of these ecosystems. Here, we used a deep-learning species distribution model to characterize the interspecific interactions occurring in an intertidal benthic invertebrate community while accounting for abiotic factors. The data include {$>$}30,000 samples collected between 2008 and 2020, over a spatial grid of more than 2400 km2 in the Wadden Sea. The benthic invertebrates in the Wadden Sea were shown to form a stable community where species engage in relatively few strong interactions in a larger network of weak interactions. This corroborates classical theory on stability–connectivity relations. We provide a stepping stone for species-specific analysis by showing that the numbers of interaction link to functional species traits. However, the biological interpretation of these links remains open. We conclude that rather than posing a catch-all solution for improving our understanding of benthic invertebrate communities, our approach provides a baseline interaction mapping tool and starting point for more targeted experiments to elucidate underlying mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Migratory species are expected to demonstrate habitat selection that occurs at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Western monarch butterflies migrate seasonally to overwintering groves at geographically predictable locations along the coast of California. To date, overwintering habitat selection by western monarch butterflies has primarily been studied assuming the microclimate hypothesis. Specifically, that microclimate habitat selection occurs when monarchs form dense overwintering aggregations in overwintering groves. However, western monarch butterflies are migratory; thus, previous habitat selection studies could have commingled selection at different scales into a single local scale in the site of aggregation. Therefore, we explore monarch overwintering habitat selection to determine whether an explicit spatial framework is necessary. We studied nine groves on the coast of California, and at each we collected temperature, humidity, and light data from grove edges, grove interiors, and aggregation locations for several weeks during the overwintering season. We tested the hypothesis that monarchs aggregate in locations in groves that have a unique microclimate that is consistently selected across groves (the microclimate hypothesis). We find no evidence supporting the hypothesis that aggregation locations have a unique microclimate that differs significantly from that of other locations inside the grove or that aggregation locations are uniform in their microclimatic attributes across overwintering groves. Rather, we find that microclimatic attributes in aggregation locations vary spatially with latitude, and that aggregation conditions exist in a large portion of each grove. We conclude that it will be necessary to consider spatial effects when studying or managing western monarch butterfly overwintering habitats, and that interpretations of habitat selection to date likely commingle habitat selection on the local and geographical scales.},
  annotation = {This is a critical paper to my thesis, and in many ways, my master's is the sequel to this project. It investigated the "microclimate hypothesis" directly and challenges long held understanding of how monarchs select overwintering habitat. In particular, they did not find any compelling evidence that there are "special" pockets of suitable habitat within groves (e.g. where aggregations occur), and instead found temperature, humidity, and ligth conditions to be fairly consistent. They also found that each site measured was significiantly different than the others, suggesting that there is more flexibility in suitable conditions than previously thought. This study, however, did not address wind protection, thought to be a critical factor in the microclimate model, and offers many sections that lend justification to my project directly.},

  abstract = {The influence of predation on rocky intertidal community structure has long emphasized the importance of indirect interactions. Most efforts in this area have focused on the density-mediated, or lethal effects, of predators on prey density. Recently, there has been growing interest in trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs): the presence of a predator in the environment influences the interaction between two other species (prey and their resource) by altering a trait of the prey species. For example, waterborne cues released by predators can cause changes in prey species behavior, such as feeding rates, thereby altering the impact of the prey species on their resources. Thus, TMIIs represent the nonlethal effects of predators that contrast with the more traditional emphasis on lethal indirect effects. Marine ecologists are just beginning to explore the role of TMIIs in their systems. We examined whether risk cues released by a ubiquitous crab predator (Carcinus maenas) influence the abundance of two dominant species in the rocky intertidal zone (barnacles [Semibalanus balanoides] and fucoid algae [Ascophyllum nodosum]) by altering the behavior of two of its snail prey (Nucella lapillus and Littorina littorea). We found that the presence of green crab risk cues can have strong cascading indirect effects on the abundance of barnacles and fucoid algae. N. lapillus exposed to risk cues consumed up to 29\% fewer barnacles compared to conspecifics feeding in the absence of risk cues, whereas L. littorea exposed to risk cues consumed 459\% fewer fucoids compared to conspecifics feeding in the absence of risk cues. These cascading interactions appear to reflect suppression of snail feeding by predator risk cues. In both food chains, snails exhibited more refuge-seeking behavior and grew less in the presence of risk cues. Our experiments suggest that TMIIs may have an important and underappreciated influence on species interactions that shape community dynamics on rocky intertidal shores. Corresponding Editor: P. T.

  abstract = {Despite an upsurge of interest in spatial interactions between communities and in the impact of dispersal on ecological and evolutionary processes, dispersal patterns and dynamics in natural metacommunities remain poorly understood. Although passive aerial dispersal of freshwater invertebrates is generally accepted, the frequency and relative importance of wind as a vector is still subject of considerable debate. We assessed the importance of wind dispersal in an invertebrate metacommunity in a cluster of 36 temporary rock pools on an isolated mountaintop in South Africa. Wind dispersal was quantified every four days using nine windsocks (about 1.5 m above rock base), placed in the field during one month. Distance to the nearest pool varied from 2 up to 16 m. Wind direction and speed were monitored for the entire period. About 850 propagules (mostly resting eggs) of 17 taxa were captured. The presence of water in the pools (level of exposure of the dormant propagule bank) and the dominant wind direction were the key factors affecting the yield. Wind speed was much less important. Our results suggest that wind dispersal of propagules from temporary aquatic systems is more frequent than previously thought. This may stabilise the metacommunity by mediating gene flow among populations and facilitating rapid (re)colonisation of patches. On the other hand, wind erosion of the dormant propagule bank may lead to egg bank depletion and local extinction. The measured frequent wind dispersal most likely fuels strong species sorting processes ultimately shaping the structure of the local communities as observed in an earlier study.

  abstract = {Wind, a major source of environmental noise, forces invertebrates that communicate with plant-borne vibrations to adjust their signaling when communicating in windy conditions. However, the strategies that animals use to reduce the impact of wind noise on communication are not well studied. We investigated the effects of wind on the production of tremulatory signals in the neotropical katydid Copiphora brevirostris. First, we recorded katydid signaling activity and natural wind variation in the field. Additionally, we exposed katydid couples during their most active signaling time period to artificial wind of different levels, and we recorded the number of tremulations produced by the males. We found that wind levels are at their lowest between 2:00 and 5:00 in the morning, which coincides with peak signaling period for male katydids. Furthermore, we found that males produce significantly fewer tremulations when exposed to wind rather than acoustic noise or silence. Wind velocity significantly affected the number of tremulations produced during the wind treatment, with fewer tremulations produced with higher wind velocities. Our results show that katydids can time their vibratory signaling both in the short- and long-term to favorable sensory conditions, either through behavioral flexibility in response to short-term fluctuations in wind or as a result of an evolutionary process in response to predictable periods of low-wind conditions.},

Analysis of the photographs permitted us to calculate site factors that quantify the proportion of indirect and direct rudiation re- ceived relative to completely open conditions. The perma- nently occupied sites exhibited a narrow range of indirect rudiation and a slightly wider but still narrow range of an- nual direct rudiation Transient sites exhibited a wider range of indirect and annual direct radiation than the permanent sites. Within the largest aggregation site, horizontal and ver- tical variation in site factors was considerable. Changes in monthly direct rudiation with height may be unpredictable and reduce confidence in extrapolations from near ground level to the height of butterfly clusters. Sites that formerly},
  annotation = {One of the early and often cited papers that establishes wind protection and other microclimate variables as important to overwintering monarchs. This paper, however, does not address wind in any measureable way, and instead only hints at the proxy via hemispherical photography. This data presented here was more related to direct and indirect light penetration throughout the year, and how overwintering sites compare to nonoverwintering sites. There are no statistical claims made, just explatory plots explained. Ultimately, this hemispherical technique has gone on to be used widely in monarch conservation since this paper, and is used today. I have collaborated with Stu, and can see the beginnings of many of his ideas in this paper.},

  abstract = {1. Previous work has suggested that species diversity in resource-limited insect communities on patchy resources is maintained by spatial aggregation, not by resource partitioning. The most comprehensive test of this claim to date was by Shorrocks \& Sevenster (1995), but some of their datasets included only a few resource types, which reduces the likelihood of finding a strong effect of resource partitioning. Also, methods of analysis have since been refined, e.g. to account for patch size. 2. We collected 733 mushroom samples belonging to 66 taxa in a Dutch woodland area. From these mushrooms, 38,891 insects were reared, belonging to 60 taxa of Diptera and Hymenoptera. Drosophilid species and their parasitoids were identified to the species level; other taxa to the family level. We argue that the community is resource limited. 3. Generally, the insects have fairly narrow diets, including only a few of the available mushroom species. The degree of niche overlap varies widely in this community. 4. Within single resource types, co-existence can be explained by intra-specific aggregation over patches alone, in accordance with previous studies. 5. This conclusion remains unchanged for the mycophagous community as a whole: intra-specific aggregation of competitors is a sufficient and necessary mechanism for co-existence in this diverse community, while resource partitioning does not contribute detectably to species diversity. This is the first time that this pattern has been demonstrated in a dataset involving such a large number of resource types. 6. Our conclusions are strongly supported by data manipulations in which we removed or intensified the effect of resource partitioning and spatial aggregation. 7. We argue that this community may be close to saturation, but we emphasize that saturation is a gradual phenomenon in patchy systems. 8. Since differential use of resource types does not reduce competitive interactions among the insects, it seems unlikely that inter-specific competition constitutes the selective pressure favouring specialization.},

  abstract = {While many studies have demonstrated that ants provide beneficial services to aphids, Bristow (Ant-plant interactions, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 104–119, 1991) first questioned why so few aphid species are ant-attended. Phylogenetic trees have demonstrated multiple gains and loss of ant-attendance in the course of aphid-ant interactions, implying that mutualisms easily form and dissolve. Several studies have reported the factors that influence the formation and maintenance of aphid-ant interactions. Examples include the physiological costs of ant attendance, competition for mutualistic ants, ant predation on aphids, the influence of host plants, and parasitoid wasps. Recent physiological techniques have also revealed the chemical component of aphid-ant mutualisms. The honeydew of ant-attended aphids contains melezitose (a trisaccharide), which has an important role in aphid-ant interactions. Studies of cuticular hydrocarbons on aphids and ants have clarified the underlying mechanisms of ant predation on aphids. Attending ants also reduce aphid dispersal ability, causing the formation of fragmented aphid populations with low genetic diversity in each population. The reduced aphid dispersal could be partly explained by higher wing loading and reduction of flight apparatus due to ant attendance. Whether ant attendance is associated with the range of host plants of aphids or genetic variation in microorganism in aphids remain to be explored.},
