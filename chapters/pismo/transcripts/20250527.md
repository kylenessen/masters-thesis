# Wind Meter Positioning and Data Accuracy

## Initial Placement and Measurement
The wind meters were placed opportunistically during the data collection period. I already have some language about this in my methods section. At the time of installation, I used a **Nikon Forester Hypsometer** to measure the **height above ground** for each sensor. To keep track of sensor locations during downloads, I recorded **rough coordinates using my phone**.

## Precise Location Mapping (September 2024)
In **September 2024**, I revisited the sites using a **laser offset mapping method** to determine more **precise coordinates** for the sensors. This process involved using an **Eos Arrow GNSS receiver** with **NTRIP correction**, which enabled **~10 cm horizontal accuracy**.  
From two known vantage points, I fired a laser to the sensor and calculated its position by triangulating the **intersection of the two measured radii**.

## Corrections and Use of Geode GPS
Upon review, I discovered that **several sensor locations were incorrectly mapped**. To correct this, I returned to the field with a **Juniper Geode GPS receiver** (sub-meter accuracy) and re-estimated the **horizontal positions** of all wind meters. I then **compared these estimates to my previously mapped points**.

- If the **survey point and Geode estimate agreed** (within ~12 meters), I defaulted to the survey point.  
- If the original location was clearly incorrect, I used the **Geode estimate** based on field observations and past experience from frequent downloads.

Regardless of positional uncertainty, I **retained the original height-above-ground measurements** from the hypsometer for all sensors, as those were consistently reliable.

# Memo Planning for Francis

## Topics to Address

### Sensor Positioning Summary
A formal summary of the wind meter positioning process, including the corrections mentioned above.

### Progress Update on Image Labeling
I will include a **table** summarizing progress. This can be based on my current Excel spreadsheet but will require a brief review of the images beforehand.

### October 20th Meeting
I’d like to propose **milestones** that can help us plan ahead and better communicate our roadmap to the committee. This will also help me gauge how urgently tasks need to be completed.

### Wind Data Cleanup Plan
I need to outline how I plan to clean up the wind data.  
My current approach:

- **Tackle each sensor individually**, since the total number of sensors is fewer than 20.  
- Consider developing **automated tests** using existing historical data.  
- Investigate **variance** as a quality metric — e.g., high variance could indicate sensor noise.  
- Compare each sensor’s data against historic weather station data to spot anomalies.

# Project Completion Planning

## Pismo and Vandenberg Sites

- **Pismo**: I’ll outline the remaining tasks needed to wrap up this project.
- **Vandenberg**: Progress is steady. The remaining tasks include:
  - Completing image labeling  
  - Running statistical analyses  
  - Writing up conclusions  

There seems to be enough time left to complete both projects effectively.

# Transcript
Okay, this is me getting a head start on my writing for today. I want to focus on the details of the position of the wind meters. So just start from the beginning.

Right. Like we place them opportunistically. I already have some language about that in my methods.

During the data collection period, I took rough coordinates with my phone just so I could keep track of all my data downloads. But at the time of initially establishing those layers, I used the Nikon Forester Hypsometer to measure the height above ground for each sensor. Angus later September of 2024, I use a laser offset mapping method to find the precise coordinates of the sensors.

And so this involved. Come on. Using an ES arrow, which is like a.

It's like a GNSS receiver. We used Ntrip to get somewhere within 10 centimeter accuracy. And then you fire a laser twice from two vantage points and where the radius of those circles intersect, that's your point.

Fortunately two, I need to confirm that number of the sensor locations were mapped incorrectly. And I realized that too late. So I went back recently with the geode, which is a sub meter gps, and estimated the horizontal position for all the wind meters and then compared them to my map points.

And so where. Where the points agreed, I just defaulted to the survey point, which is like within 12 meters of each other, you know, because I'm estimating the spot even though I know pretty well where they all landed because I downloaded them so many times. And the uncertainty of the.

The unit under canopy, who for the ones that were really obviously wrong. I defaulted to the geode based on my best guess where it was. And I think for all points because I was able to measure them, measure the height above ground reliably, I'll use that metric.

So I think that would be good to get situated, get that in the methods a little more formally. And then for my memo to Francis, that should definitely be an action item to talk about. Wow, look at that thing go.

Since I'm on the topic, let's just think about other things to get Francis's attention on. I should probably just give him an update on how the progress is going. Progress on the image labeling.

I think a table would be good. I don't think I need a lot more work based on the Excel table I already have. That requires me to review the images though.

What else I want to talk to St. Francis about, probably going to talk to him about that October 20th date and to maybe outline some milestones so that I can respond to the committee about our roadmap. I think that would be very helpful for me to manage well, to at least know how stressed I should be.

I should also have some plan or some words on how I plan to deal with the wind data cleanup. What does that look like? Give me some ideas which I've explored elsewhere. It's like tackle each sensor one by one, you know, just because it is a.

There's a manageable number. It's like less than 20. And that way I can just squeegee through and see how it goes.

I guess I could share. I have all of the historical data, a bunch of those sites, and come on kind of as like an automated test. I'm playing around with the idea of using variants, see if there's issues.

Right. Like, I imagine if a weather station is recording noisy data, we'd see higher variants and we can compare that against. Compare that against all the historic weather stations, right.

For like any moment in time. Calculate like a background variance, compare the variants to the historical weather stations. It's probably also worth sharing my outline what it's going to take to finish the Pismo project.

And we'll see how much time is available. But might be worth doing the same for Vandenberg. Even though I think at this point, right.

It's just like get the images done and then play with the stats and draw your conclusion and then write it up. So I actually think that one is going reasonably well. I think there's enough time to do this.

Okay, I'm gonna call here.
