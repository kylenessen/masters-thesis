\subsection{Study Site}
Pismo State Beach Monarch Butterfly Grove (Pismo) was chosen for my wind study for several reasons. 
- A reliable site for monarch butterflies, where there are usually large number of clusters on any given year. Even in bad years (like 2024) butterflies are present where most sites are empty. Routinely in the top 10 sites by number every year (cite? Check?). 
- The surrounding environment is relatively free of confounding factors for a wind simulation. The ocean is immediately to the west of the site, allowing a free an unobstructed path for wind. There are also very few hills in the immediate area, and all the nearby structures are no more than two stories (some small percentage of the total height of the trees). 
- Pismo has a rich history of research which this project will contribute to
- Pismo has some of the highest frequency counts of any site in California. This data can be combined with the results of this wind study for future projects. 
- Pismo is located in San Luis Obispo County, California near the city of Pismo. It is approximately 10 acres in size and characterized by large, over mature blue gums (\textit{Eucalyptus globulus}). The Pacific Ocean is directly west of the site and is about 0.5km away.
