\section{Hypotheses and Predictions}

\subsection{Wind Dispersal Hypothesis (H1)}

\textbf{Hypothesis:} Higher wind speeds are negatively correlated with monarch butterfly abundance at overwintering sites, as increased wind causes monarchs to leave their roosting locations.

\textbf{Prediction:} We predict a significant negative correlation between wind speed measurements and changes in monarch abundance, where higher wind speeds correspond to decreases in butterfly counts at monitoring sites.

\textbf{Proposed Analysis:}
We will test this hypothesis using a mixed-effects linear model with temporal autocorrelation to account for the hierarchical structure of our data and time-series dependencies. The response variable will be the change in monarch abundance calculated between consecutive observation periods, allowing for both positive (recruitment/clustering) and negative (departure/dispersal) values. Primary fixed effects will include mean wind speed (averaged across the observation period), maximum wind speed, 95th percentile wind speed, and wind speed variance, which together capture the overall wind exposure, peak wind events, extreme conditions, and gustiness experienced during each observation interval.

In addition to testing linear wind relationships, we will explore threshold effects through several complementary approaches. We may implement segmented regression to identify potential breakpoints in wind-abundance relationships, allowing the data to reveal critical wind speeds where monarch behavior changes. Alternatively, we could employ smoothing splines or piecewise regression to capture non-linear responses to wind exposure. These threshold discovery methods will help determine whether wind effects on monarch abundance are gradual and continuous or exhibit sharp transitions at specific wind speeds.

To account for non-independence in our data structure, we will include random intercepts for camera view (to control for site-specific variation) and labeler identity (to control for observer effects in abundance estimation). Given the temporal nature of abundance measurements, we will incorporate an AR(1) autocorrelation structure to model the expected correlation between consecutive time points, which is critical for obtaining unbiased parameter estimates in time-series ecological data.

Model diagnostics will include examination of residual plots, normality assessment, and validation of the autocorrelation structure. We anticipate reporting standardized effect sizes for wind variables, 95\% confidence intervals for all parameters, and visualization of the predicted relationship between wind speed and abundance change. If threshold effects are detected, we will report the estimated breakpoint(s) with confidence intervals. A significant negative coefficient for wind speed variables would support our hypothesis that increased wind conditions drive monarch dispersal from overwintering sites.

The statistical model will be implemented in R using the \texttt{nlme} package as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
# Linear model
model_h1_linear <- lme(abundance_change ~ mean_wind_speed + max_wind_speed + 
                       wind_speed_95th + wind_speed_variance,
                       random = ~ 1 | view/labeler,
                       correlation = corAR1(form = ~ time_index | view),
                       data = monarch_wind_data,
                       method = "REML")

# Threshold discovery using segmented regression
library(segmented)
model_h1_segmented <- segmented(model_h1_linear, 
                               seg.Z = ~ mean_wind_speed,
                               npsi = 1)  # test for 1 breakpoint
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Critical Wind Threshold Hypothesis (H2)}

\textbf{Hypothesis:} Monarch butterflies abandon overwintering sites when wind speeds exceed Kingston Leong's critical threshold of ~5 mph (2.2 m/s).

\textbf{Prediction:} We predict that exposure to wind speeds exceeding 2.2 m/s will be significantly associated with negative changes in monarch abundance.

\textbf{Proposed Analysis:}
We will test the Kingston Leong threshold hypothesis using a simple mixed-effects model that directly examines the relationship between threshold exceedance and abundance change. The response variable will be change in monarch abundance between consecutive observation periods. The primary fixed effect will be \texttt{minutes\_above\_2.2ms}, representing the total duration (in minutes) that wind speeds exceeded the Kingston threshold during each observation interval.

This focused approach tests the specific claim that 2.2~m/s represents a critical threshold for monarch site abandonment, independent of other wind characteristics. We will include the same random effects structure as H1 (random intercepts for camera view and labeler identity) and AR(1) temporal autocorrelation to account for data dependencies.

A significant negative coefficient for \texttt{minutes\_above\_2.2ms} would support the Kingston Leong threshold hypothesis, while a non-significant result would suggest that this specific threshold may not be biologically meaningful for monarch site abandonment behavior.

The statistical model will be implemented in R using the \texttt{nlme} package as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
model_h2 <- lme(abundance_change ~ minutes_above_2.2ms,
                random = ~ 1 | view/labeler,
                correlation = corAR1(form = ~ time_index | view),
                data = monarch_wind_data,
                method = "REML")
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Site Fidelity Loss Hypothesis (H3)}

\textbf{Hypothesis:} Following exposure to wind speeds exceeding 5~mph while monarchs are present, butterflies will not return to previously occupied sites, indicating permanent abandonment after high-wind events.

\textbf{Prediction:} We predict that morning abundance counts will remain near zero at sites following days when both monarchs were present and wind speeds exceeded 5~mph, with the predictor variable ``days since last threshold exceeded'' showing no recovery in abundance for values greater than zero.

\textbf{Proposed Analysis:}
% TODO: Add specific analytical approach for H3

\subsection{Thermal Regulation Hypothesis (H4)}

\textbf{Hypothesis:} Overwintering monarch butterflies modify their clustering behavior in response to direct sunlight exposure, with this effect moderated by ambient temperature, as monarchs are sensitive to overheating risks.

\textbf{Prediction:} We predict a significant interaction between sunlight exposure proportion and ambient temperature on changes in monarch abundance, where the combination of high direct sunlight exposure and elevated temperatures will produce the greatest negative changes in butterfly counts, particularly during morning observation periods when clusters are most likely to disband.
