\subsection{Data Summary and Model Selection}

In total, we analyzed 1,894 observation pairs spanning 115 unique deployment–day combinations. We evaluated 47 candidate models within a generalized additive mixed modeling (GAMM) framework and performed model selection using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC).

The best-supported model included smooth terms for average temperature, direct sun exposure, time within day, and the lagged butterfly count. This best-fit model (label: \texttt{M22\_temp\_time}) had an AIC of 8081.848, a \(\Delta\)AIC of 0.0, and an AIC weight of 0.88, indicating it received 88\% of the support among all candidates. The next-best model (\texttt{M21\_time\_of\_day}) was 4.796 AIC units higher (AIC = 8086.644), reflecting substantially weaker support.

\subsection{Best-Fit Model Structure and Effects}

The best-fit model had the form:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{butterfly\_difference\_cbrt \textasciitilde\ s(total\_butterflies\_t\_lag) + s(temperature\_avg) + s(butterflies\_direct\_sun\_t\_lag) + s(time\_within\_day\_t)}
\end{quote}

This model explained a modest portion of the variability (adjusted \(R^2\) = 0.0568) but identified several statistically and biologically meaningful patterns:

- Lagged roost size, \(s(\texttt{total\_butterflies\_t\_lag})\): A significant, non-linear negative association with subsequent change in abundance (edf = 2.621, \(F\) = 12.020, \(p = 8.26 \times 10^{-7}\)). Larger initial roosts tended to decline more in the next interval (see Figure~\ref{fig:partial_effects}).
- Average temperature, \(s(\texttt{temperature\_avg})\): A significant, non-linear relationship (edf = 3.930, \(F\) = 3.230, \(p = 0.0283\)), with the effect peaking near \(\sim\!20\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) before declining (Figure~\ref{fig:partial_effects}).
- Direct sun exposure, \(s(\texttt{butterflies\_direct\_sun\_t\_lag})\): A significant negative association (edf = 1.534, \(F\) = 19.356, \(p = 1.22 \times 10^{-5}\)), wherein greater prior sun exposure corresponded to larger decreases in roost abundance (Figure~\ref{fig:partial_effects}).
- Diurnal pattern, \(s(\texttt{time\_within\_day\_t})\): A significant, non-linear within-day pattern (edf = 4.898, \(F\) = 8.901, \(p < 2 \times 10^{-16}\)) indicating cyclical changes across the day (Figure~\ref{fig:partial_effects}).

\subsection{Evaluation of the Disruptive Wind Hypothesis}

We evaluated three hierarchical hypotheses about wind effects on overwintering monarchs:

- Hypothesis 1 (wind as a disruptive force): Not supported. Wind predictors did not appear in the top-performing models under AIC-based selection, indicating wind was not a primary driver of short-interval changes in roost abundance.
- Hypothesis 2 (disruption above a 2\,m/s threshold): Not supported. A sensitivity analysis using a threshold variable (minutes with wind speed \(>\) 2\,m/s) also failed to yield models with improved support.
- Hypothesis 3 (disruption scaling with intensity): Not supported. The gust intensity predictor (\texttt{max\_gust}) did not appear in top-ranked models.

The two wind metrics used in these parallel tests (\texttt{max\_gust} and minutes above threshold) were themselves highly correlated (\(r = 0.78\)), suggesting they capture similar aspects of the wind regime without explaining changes in roost abundance.

\subsection{Model Diagnostics}

Model diagnostics were consistent with the above findings while revealing limitations inherent to the response structure:

- Residuals vs. fitted: Residuals exhibited visible linear banding/patterning, indicative of unexplained structure arising from the discretized, binned counting method underlying the response (Figure~\ref{subfig:resid_fitted}).
- Normal Q–Q: Residuals were approximately normal with some tail deviations, consistent with the structure observed in the residuals–fitted plot (Figure~\ref{subfig:qq}).
