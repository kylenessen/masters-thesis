\subsection{Summary of Data and Model Selection}

Environmental factors, but not wind, drove monarch abundance changes in 1,894 paired observations from 115 monitoring periods at two overwintering sites during the 2023-2024 season. Testing of 48 candidate models identified M23 as the best-fit model.

Model M23 included smooth terms for previous butterfly count, temperature, butterflies in direct sun, and time since sunrise, achieving an AIC value of 8081.848 (Table~\ref{tab:model_selection}). This model accounted for 88\% of the model weight (AIC weight = 0.88), with the next-best model (M22) showing substantially less support (ΔAIC = 4.796). Wind variables appeared in only one of the top five models (M24), which included maximum wind speed but performed substantially worse than M23 (ΔAIC = 6.2, AIC weight = 0.04), with the wind effect showing weak evidence of an association (p = 0.218).

Model terms are shown with their respective AIC values, ΔAIC relative to the best model, and AIC weights across the five top performing models. Given that no models are regarded as equivalent to the best fit model (M23), the actual weight of M23 is 1.0. Wind p-values are shown where applicable; NA indicates the model did not include wind variables.}

\subsection{Analysis of the Best-Fit Model}

The best-fit model (M23) explained 5.7\% of variance in monarch abundance changes (adjusted R² = 0.057). The model formula was:

\begin{equation}
\text{Change in abundance} \sim s(\text{Previous butterfly count}) + s(\text{Temperature}) + s(\text{Butterflies in direct sun}) + s(\text{Time since sunrise})
\end{equation}

where $s()$ denotes smooth terms. All four smooth terms showed significant effects on monarch abundance changes.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\caption{Summary of smooth terms in the best-fit model (M23). EDF represents effective degrees of freedom, indicating the complexity of each smooth relationship.}\label{tab:smooth_terms}
\begin{tabular}{lrrrr}
\hline
Term & EDF & Ref.~df & F-value & p-value \\
\hline
Previous butterfly count & 2.62 & 2.62 & 12.02 & 8.26e-07 \\
Temperature & 3.93 & 3.93 & 3.23 & 0.028 \\
Butterflies in direct sun & 1.53 & 1.53 & 19.36 & 1.22e-05 \\
Time since sunrise & 4.90 & 4.90 & 8.90 & <2e-16 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

All four predictors in the best-fit model showed significant effects on monarch abundance changes (Figure~\ref{fig:partial_effects}). The previous butterfly count exhibited a significant non-linear negative relationship (EDF = 2.62, F = 12.02, p < 0.001), with increasingly negative changes as the previous count increased, indicating proportionally greater departures from larger aggregations. Butterflies in direct sun showed a strong negative effect on roost abundance (EDF = 1.53, F = 19.36, p < 0.001), with greater numbers in direct sun associated with larger decreases in total abundance.

Time since sunrise revealed a pronounced diurnal pattern (EDF = 4.90, F = 8.90, p < 0.001), capturing cyclical changes in monarch activity throughout the day. Temperature exhibited a complex non-linear relationship (EDF = 3.93, F = 3.23, p = 0.028), with effects peaking at approximately 20°C.

\subsection{Evaluation of the Disruptive Wind Hypothesis}

Our analysis provided no support for the three hierarchical wind hypotheses:

First, wind did not act as a disruptive force to overwintering monarchs. Among our 48 candidate models, wind appeared in only one of the top five models (M24), where it showed little evidence of an effect (p = 0.218) and resulted in substantially poorer model performance compared to the best model (ΔAIC = 6.2).

Second, we found no evidence for disruption above the proposed 2~m/s threshold. A sensitivity analysis using a specific threshold predictor ('minutes with wind speed > 2~m/s') confirmed this lack of a threshold effect, as models with this variable performed poorly and did not rank among the top candidates. Visually, the relationship between wind and monarch abundance change remained flat across the 2~m/s boundary (Figure~\ref{fig:wind_scatter}). With mean maximum wind speeds of 2.2~m/s (SD = 1.4~m/s), conditions that should have revealed threshold effects if present, no disruption occurred at or above this boundary.

Third, wind's effects did not scale with intensity. The relationship remained flat across all observed wind speeds (0–12~m/s), with confidence intervals consistently encompassing zero (Figure~\ref{fig:wind_scatter}).

The red dashed line shows the proposed 2 m/s disruptive wind threshold, while the flat trend line indicates no effect of wind on butterfly departures. Points represent 30-minute observation periods.}\label{fig:wind_scatter}

\subsection{Statistical Power to Detect Wind Effects}

Post-hoc power analysis confirmed our study had adequate statistical power to detect biologically meaningful wind effects (Table~\ref{tab:power_analysis}). With 1,894 paired observations, we achieved 87.5\% power to detect moderate effect sizes (0.15 standard deviations) and 98.5\% power to detect larger effects (0.20 standard deviations). Power for small effects (0.10 standard deviations) was 56\%, while very small effects (0.05 standard deviations) yielded only 16.5\% power. These results indicate that our failure to detect wind effects is unlikely due to insufficient statistical power for effect sizes of biological relevance.

\subsection{Model Diagnostics}

Model residuals showed distinct linear banding patterns consistent with the discrete counting method used to estimate butterfly abundance, while the Q-Q plot indicated approximately normal residual distribution with minor tail deviations (Figure~\ref{fig:diagnostics}).
