\subsection{Wind Does Not Disrupt Overwintering Monarch Butterflies}

Our study provides the first direct empirical test of the disruptive wind hypothesis and finds no support for wind as a primary factor influencing monarch butterfly clustering behavior. Despite the widespread adoption of the 2 m/s wind threshold in conservation practice \autocite{xercesGuideWesternMonarch2025}, our data reveal no relationship between wind speed and butterfly departures across the full range of observed conditions (0--12 m/s). While our models explain only 5.7\% of variance in butterfly movements, reflecting our focus on testing wind effects rather than comprehensively explaining movement patterns, they had sufficient statistical power to detect environmental signals. This finding challenges assumptions underlying three decades of management guidance and suggests that our understanding of overwintering habitat requirements warrants reconsideration.

The absence of wind effects in our data is particularly striking given that mean maximum wind speeds (2.2 m/s, SD = 1.4) frequently exceeded the proposed threshold. If the disruptive wind hypothesis were valid, we should have observed a clear signal: transitions from aggregated butterflies to zero butterflies, as strictly predicted by the hypothesis. Instead, we observed no change, small changes, or even positive changes in butterfly abundance at wind speeds six times the proposed threshold. 

Importantly, our analysis had adequate statistical power to detect biologically meaningful wind effects. Power analysis demonstrated 87.5\% power to detect moderate effect sizes (0.15 standard deviations) and 98.5\% power for larger effects (0.20 standard deviations). The non-significant wind effect (p = 0.218) when forced into the best model, combined with this high statistical power, allows us to rule out all but very small wind effects. Given that the disruptive wind hypothesis predicts complete cluster abandonment above threshold speeds, a large effect by any measure, our failure to detect such patterns provides strong evidence against the hypothesis rather than merely absence of evidence.

The methodological validity of our approach is confirmed by the strong signals detected for other environmental variables. Had our counting method or analytical framework been flawed, we would not have captured the pronounced effects of direct sunlight (F = 19.36, p < 0.001) or the complex diurnal patterns (F = 8.90, p < 0.001) that emerged from the same dataset.

\subsection{Alternative Drivers of Monarch Movement}

While our study was designed specifically to test the wind hypothesis rather than identify all factors influencing monarch movement, our results suggest that thermoregulation, light exposure, and diurnal rhythms may play more important roles than wind in driving short-term movements at overwintering sites. These patterns align with fundamental principles of insect physiology and behavior, though further research is needed to definitively establish their relative importance.

\subsubsection{Thermoregulation as a Potential Driver}

Temperature effects on monarch abundance changes exhibited a clear optimum at approximately 20�C, consistent with previous work on thermal requirements of overwintering monarchs \autocite{masters_thermal_1988}. The non-linear relationship we observed suggests monarchs actively manage their body temperature through movement between microhabitats. Below the thermal optimum, butterflies remained clustered, likely conserving energy through reduced metabolic rates. Above 20�C, increased departures may reflect butterflies seeking cooler microsites or engaging in flight-dependent activities enabled by warmer conditions.

The strong negative effect of direct sunlight on roost abundance provides critical insight into thermoregulatory behavior. Butterflies exposed to direct sunlight at the beginning of an observation interval showed the largest decreases in abundance, suggesting rapid warming triggers immediate behavioral responses. This finding aligns with studies showing that even 10 minutes of direct sun exposure can raise thoracic temperatures to levels requiring behavioral modification \autocite{masters_thermal_1988}. The relationship between sunlight and departure helps resolve an apparent paradox: while monarchs have evolved efficient solar heat absorption capabilities, excessive warming forces them to abandon energetically favorable clustering positions.

\subsubsection{Diurnal Activity Patterns}

The pronounced diurnal pattern in butterfly movements persisted even after controlling for temperature and sunlight, indicating an underlying circadian rhythm. Butterfly numbers typically increased during morning hours, then decreased as temperatures warmed, with most individuals departing by midday. This pattern suggests that rapid warming capability through solar absorption enables monarchs to engage in daily activities while returning to roosts as conditions cool. The ability to quickly elevate body temperature through basking may thus facilitate, rather than disrupt, the maintenance of overwintering aggregations by allowing brief periods of activity within an otherwise quiescent state.
\subsection{Light as a Predictable Environmental Cue}

The strong effect of direct sunlight on butterfly movements (F = 19.36, p < 0.001) suggests light exposure may be a key driver of clustering behavior. Unlike wind, which varies stochastically at fine spatial scales, light patterns created by canopy structure remain relatively stable across seasons and years. This stability could provide monarchs with reliable cues for habitat selection, potentially explaining the consistent use of specific trees and branches documented across overwintering sites. The relationship between light exposure and thermoregulation, combined with the predictability of canopy-created light patterns, warrants further investigation as a primary factor in roost site selection.

\subsection{Study Limitations}

Several limitations of our study warrant consideration when interpreting these findings. First, our data derive from a single overwintering season (2023--2024) at only a few monitoring locations, primarily within Spring Canyon grove, with additional limited data from UDMH. The historically low monarch abundance during our second field season (2024--2025) prevented temporal replication. Second, monarch populations during our study period were substantially lower than during the early 1990s when the wind hypothesis was first formulated. It remains possible that wind effects manifest differently at higher butterfly densities.

Third, our counting methodology, while necessary to process tens of thousands of images, introduced discretization artifacts and reduced temporal resolution. The 30-minute sampling interval may have missed brief wind-induced disturbances that quickly resolved. However, any such transient effects would need to be reconciled with the hypothesis's prediction of sustained abandonment above the wind threshold.

\subsection{Management Implications}

Our findings suggest that management strategies prioritizing wind protection warrant reconsideration. While our study represents a single season at one primary site, the absence of wind effects despite frequent threshold exceedances raises questions about current habitat assessment criteria.

If wind is not a primary limiting factor, the usable habitat within existing groves may be much larger than currently recognized. Conservation practice often assumes that only a small portion of each grove provides suitable conditions, with the remainder serving primarily as a wind buffer. However, areas within groves previously dismissed due to perceived wind exposure may actually provide suitable overwintering conditions if they offer appropriate light regimes and thermal conditions. The historically low monarch numbers over the past decade may have concentrated butterflies in traditionally favored locations, leaving much of the potentially suitable habitat within each grove unoccupied.

While past management efforts aimed at wind protection may have been based on incomplete understanding, they likely produced beneficial outcomes by increasing tree density and canopy complexity. The fundamental recommendation to plant and maintain trees remains sound, even as our understanding of the underlying mechanisms continues to evolve.

The widespread use of large trees by monarchs across overwintering sites supports continued emphasis on mature tree conservation and planting. Management should prioritize maintaining existing mature trees while establishing future roosting habitat. We recommend planting trees at densities that support healthy, long-lived growth, as trees can be selectively thinned if needed but cannot be quickly replaced once lost.

\subsection{Future Research Directions}

Our findings open several important avenues for future research. First, explicit testing of light patterns as predictors of clustering locations could establish whether canopy structure guides habitat selection. Given the strong effect of direct sunlight in our models, understanding how monarchs use visual cues to evaluate potential roost sites could provide predictive power for identifying suitable habitat.

Second, investigation of social dynamics and positive feedback mechanisms could explain some of the unexplained variation in our models. Monarchs may exhibit emergent clustering behaviors where initial settlement by a few individuals increases the probability of others joining, creating self-reinforcing patterns independent of immediate environmental conditions. Understanding whether clustering exhibits emergent properties beyond individual decision-making could substantially improve our approach to habitat creation and management.

Research should also examine whether our findings extend across the broader overwintering range. Testing these patterns at sites with different tree species, latitudes, and population densities would strengthen conclusions about the generality of wind effects, or their absence. Long-term studies capturing year-to-year variation in the same groves could distinguish between stochastic and deterministic processes in site selection.

\subsection{Conclusions}

The monarch butterfly's overwintering phenomenon represents one of nature's most remarkable migrations, transforming coastal California groves into spectacular aggregations each winter. Within our study system, wind did not disrupt monarch clusters even at speeds far exceeding established thresholds. Instead, our data suggest butterflies responded more strongly to thermal conditions, light exposure, and diurnal rhythms, though the relative importance of these factors requires further investigation.

These findings suggest the need to reevaluate assumptions about overwintering habitat requirements. While our single-season study at one primary grove cannot definitively refute decades of observation across the entire overwintering range, the absence of wind effects in our data raises important questions about current management priorities. The conservation community should remain open to updating practices as new empirical evidence emerges. As monarch populations face continued threats from habitat loss and climate change, evidence-based management becomes increasingly critical. By better understanding the factors driving habitat selection and clustering behavior, we can more effectively conserve the overwintering sites essential for the persistence of this iconic species.
