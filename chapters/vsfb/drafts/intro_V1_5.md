**Proposed Analysis:** We will test this hypothesis using a
mixed-effects linear model with temporal autocorrelation to account for
the hierarchical structure of our data and time-series dependencies. The
response variable will be the change in monarch abundance calculated
between consecutive observation periods, allowing for both positive
(recruitment/clustering) and negative (departure/dispersal) values.
[These attribute should be introduced in the intro. The reader should
not be wondering about them here, but instead should be thinking \"yes,

captured.\"]{.comment-start id="92" author="Francis X. Villablanca"
date="2025-07-17T10:41:00Z"}[Noted. Perhaps we can talk about what that
might look like more tomorrow.]{.comment-start id="93"
author="Kyle Nessen" date="2025-07-23T14:11:00Z"}Primary fixed effects
will include mean wind speed (averaged across the observation period),
maximum wind speed, 95th percentile wind speed, and wind speed variance,
which together capture the overall wind exposure, peak wind events,
extreme conditions, and gustiness experienced during each observation
interval.[[]{.comment-end id="93"}]{.comment-end id="92"}

Beyond testing linear relationships, we recognize that H1 encompasses a
broad investigation of wind effects on monarch behavior. If initial
analyses suggest that wind is indeed a significant factor influencing
overwintering abundance, we propose additional approaches to
characterize the nature of these relationships. Specifically, we could
implement segmented regression to identify potential breakpoints in
wind-abundance relationships, allowing the data to reveal critical wind
speeds where monarch behavior changes. Alternatively, smoothing splines
or piecewise regression could capture non-linear responses to wind
exposure. These threshold discovery methods would help determine whether
wind effects on monarch abundance are gradual and continuous or exhibit
sharp transitions at specific wind speeds [(as proposed in the
li]{.insertion author="Francis X. Villablanca"
date="2025-07-17T17:41:00Z"}[terature)]{.insertion
author="Francis X. Villablanca" date="2025-07-17T17:42:00Z"}.

To account for non-independence in our data structure, we will include
random intercepts for camera view (to control for site-specific
variation) and labeler identity (to control for observer effects in
abundance estimation). Given the temporal nature of abundance
measurements, we will incorporate an AR(1) autocorrelation structure to
model the expected correlation between consecutive time points, which is
critical for obtaining unbiased parameter estimates in time-series
ecological data.

Model diagnostics will include examination of residual plots, normality
assessment, and validation of the autocorrelation structure. We
anticipate reporting standardized effect sizes for wind variables, 95%
confidence intervals for all parameters, and visualization of the
predicted relationship between wind speed and abundance change. If
threshold effects are detected, we will report the estimated
breakpoint(s) with confidence intervals. A [significant]{.deletion
author="Francis X. Villablanca" date="2025-07-17T17:42:00Z"} negative
coefficient for wind speed variables would support our hypothesis that
increased wind conditions drive monarch dispersal from overwintering
sites.

The statistical model will be implemented in R using the `nlme` package
as follows:

    # Linear model
    model_h1_linear <- lme(abundance_change ~ mean_wind_speed + max_wind_speed + 
                           wind_speed_95th + wind_speed_variance,
                           random = ~ 1 | view/labeler,
                           correlation = corAR1(form = ~ time_index | view),
                           data = monarch_wind_data,
                           method = "REML")

    # Threshold discovery using segmented regression
    library(segmented)
    model_h1_segmented <- segmented(model_h1_linear, 
                                   seg.Z = ~ mean_wind_speed,
                                   npsi = 1)  # test for 1 breakpoint

date="2025-07-17T17:45:00Z"} threshold hypothesis[,]{.insertion
author="Francis X. Villablanca" date="2025-07-17T17:45:00Z"} using a
simple mixed-effects model that directly examines the relationship
between threshold exceedance and abundance change. The response variable
will be change in monarch abundance between consecutive observation
periods. The primary fixed effect will be `minutes_above_2.2ms`,
representing the total duration (in minutes) that wind speeds exceeded
the Kingston threshold during each observation interval.

This focused approach tests the specific claim that 2.2 m/s represents a
critical threshold for monarch site abandonment, independent of other
wind characteristics. We will include the same random effects structure
as H1 (random intercepts for camera view and labeler identity) and AR(1)
temporal autocorrelation to account for data dependencies.

A [significant]{.deletion author="Francis X. Villablanca"
date="2025-07-17T17:46:00Z"} negative coefficient for
`minutes_above_2.2ms` would support the Kingston Leong threshold
hypothesis, while a non-significant result would suggest that this
specific threshold may not be biologically meaningful for monarch site
abandonment behavior.

The statistical model will be implemented in R using the `nlme` package
as follows:

    model_h2 <- lme(abundance_change ~ minutes_above_2.2ms,
                    random = ~ 1 | view/labeler,
                    correlation = corAR1(form = ~ time_index | view),

make sense to the reader. How about something like \"initial daily\"?\
Something tells me that we should put the sun hypothesis in as H3. I am
thinking this because somehow the \"morning after abundance\" counts
need to allow for an overnight response in abundance (morning), while
precluding any (hypothetical) response to sunlight during the morning.
If we know whether there is or isn\'t a response to sunlight, we will
know whether the abundance estimates need to be after daylight
(morning), but before direct sun on a roost. When we have that answer,
we can define the appropriate sampling/data for this analysis.\

minutes while monarchs are present (abundance \> 0). This operational
definition ensures we capture sustained wind exposure during active site
occupation, rather than brief gusts or events occurring at unoccupied
sites. The 30-minute minimum duration represents our initial analytical
approach based on photographic sampling intervals, though we anticipate
exploring alternative durations as data patterns emerge.

The response variable will be binary site occupancy status (occupied =
abundance \> 0, unoccupied = abundance = 0) derived from morning
abundance counts to avoid confounding with same-day wind effects. We
propose initially focusing on the 14-day period following each threshold
event to capture both immediate and sustained abandonment patterns
predicted by conventional wisdom, with the understanding that this
analysis window may be adjusted based on [preliminary]{.deletion

strong negative relationship where the probability of site occupation
remains near zero for all post-event time points, with no recovery
pattern over the 14-day analysis window.

This conservative analytical approach uses complete abandonment (zero
abundance) as the response threshold, giving the conventional wisdom
hypothesis the strongest possible test. If monarchs truly abandon sites
after wind exposure, this effect should be easily detectable even with
limited sample sizes. We will include random intercepts for camera view
and labeler identity to control for site-specific and observer effects,
following the same random effects structure used in H1 and H2.

Model diagnostics will focus on examining residual patterns, assessing
model convergence, and validating the binary response assumption. We
will report odds ratios for the temporal predictor, 95% confidence
intervals, and visualization of predicted occupancy probability across
the post-event time series. A [significant]{.deletion

coefficient for `days_since_wind_event` would support the site
abandonment hypothesis, while a non-significant result would challenge
current conservation guidance regarding wind exposure and habitat
suitability.

The statistical model will be implemented in R using the `glmer`
function from the `lme4` package as follows:

    library(lme4)
    model_h3 <- glmer(site_occupied ~ days_since_wind_event + (1|view) + (1|labeler),

### Thermal Regulation Hypothesis (H4) {#thermal-regulation-hypothesis-h4-1}

**Hypothesis:** Overwintering monarch butterflies modify their
clustering behavior in response to direct sunlight
exposure[.]{.insertion author="Kyle Nessen" date="2025-07-24T13:05:00Z"}
[We should keep the first part of this hypothesis, since it is about a
pattern and is therefore something we might observe. The other two parts
about moderation and overheating are mechanistic. Mechanistic meaning
that they are the cause oft he pattern. II am not sure we can observe
the cause with your data set. We could test for moderation, or really
just a correlation with temperature, but we cannot directly test for
overheating. I know you regard overheating to be the actual mechanism.
So keep that thought, and let\'s elaborate about it in the discussion
but not include it here.\
Alternatively, we could talk about this idea on Friday. I think part of
the issue is that temperature facilitates flight. Monarch butterflies
require a minimum of 55°F for proper flight muscle function. They are
known to bask in sunlight, opening the wings, and turning them towards
the sun. So it could be argued that direct sun and increase body
temperature or actually a benefit. But that benefit is present when
ambient temperatures are below 55. We would need to do some research in
order to provide references that substantiate an optimal temperature or
the opera critical temperature of the thermal neutral zone. Some of this
information is in Ashley\'s thesis. So it could be argued that direct
sunlight and increase body temperature is actually a detriment. But if I
remember, right, that detriment is above 84--90\*F. A monarch butterfly
would not be expected to Basque is increasing its temperature was
detrimental. So we would need to chat about asking as a potential
attribute to discern, which of these mechanisms is potentially acting...

**Proposed Analysis:** We will test this hypothesis using a
mixed-effects linear model with an interaction term to examine the
combined effects of sunlight exposure and ambient temperature on monarch
clustering behavior. This approach directly tests the thermal regulation
hypothesis that monarchs modify their behavior to avoid overheating when
exposed to direct sunlight under elevated temperature conditions.
Analysis will exclude observation periods with zero monarch abundance,
focusing exclusively on periods when butterflies are present to exhibit
thermal regulation behavior.

To isolate thermal regulation effects from concurrent wind influences,
we will include wind variables as covariates in our thermal regulation
model. This expanded approach tests whether sunlight-temperature
interactions remain significant predictors of monarch behavior when
accounting for wind effects, addressing the possibility that thermal and
wind factors are correlated in our dataset. By controlling for wind
while testing thermal mechanisms, this analysis approaches the broader
question of relative factor importance that might be addressed through a
comprehensive global model, but maintains focus on thermal regulation as
the primary mechanism of interest.

The response variable will be change in monarch abundance calculated
between consecutive observation periods, allowing for both positive
(clustering) and negative (dispersal) values. Our primary fixed effects
will include: (1) sunlight exposure proportion, calculated as the
proportion of butterflies experiencing direct sunlight relative to total
butterflies present during each observation period; (2) ambient
temperature, derived from temperature readings extracted via OCR from
deployment photographs; and (3) their interaction term (sunlight
exposure $\times$ ambient temperature), which tests our core prediction
that thermal effects are most pronounced when both factors are elevated.

This sunlight exposure metric addresses the key challenge of scaling
exposure measurements to population size. By calculating the proportion
of butterflies in direct sunlight relative to the total butterfly
population present, we obtain a continuous variable between 0 and 1.
Periods with zero sunlight exposure represent times when no butterflies
were positioned in sunny locations, providing natural contrast
conditions for our analysis.

To control for baseline differences between morning and afternoon
observation periods, we will include time period (morning vs. afternoon)
as a fixed effect in our model. Additionally, we will include mean wind
speed as a covariate to control for concurrent wind effects that might
confound thermal responses. This approach accounts for natural temporal
variation in monarch behavior while isolating thermal regulation
mechanisms from wind-driven dispersal effects, allowing us to test
whether sunlight-temperature interactions represent independent
behavioral drivers beyond wind influences.

We will include the same random effects structure as H1-H3 (random
intercepts for camera view and labeler identity) to control for
site-specific variation and observer effects. Given the temporal nature
of our data, we will incorporate AR(1) autocorrelation to model expected
correlation between consecutive time points, ensuring unbiased parameter
estimates in our time-series analysis.

Model diagnostics will focus on examining residual patterns, validating
the autocorrelation structure, and assessing the distribution of
sunlight exposure values. We will report interaction effect coefficients
with 95% confidence intervals, standardized effect sizes for all
predictors, and visualization of the predicted relationship between
sunlight-temperature combinations and abundance change. Results will
include the estimated effect of time period to characterize baseline
differences between morning and afternoon observations.

A significant negative interaction coefficient would support our thermal
regulation hypothesis, indicating that monarch abundance decreases most
markedly when both sunlight exposure and ambient temperature are
elevated, even when controlling for wind effects. Conversely,
non-significant interaction effects would suggest that thermal
regulation responses are not independent of wind influences or that
thermal regulation is not dependent on the combined influence of
sunlight and temperature factors. This expanded analysis will help
determine whether thermal factors represent primary drivers of monarch
behavior or secondary effects correlated with wind conditions.

The statistical model will be implemented in R using the `nlme` package
as follows:

    # Thermal regulation model with wind control
    model_h4 <- lme(abundance_change ~ sunlight_exposure_prop * ambient_temp + 
                     period + mean_wind_speed,
                    random = ~ 1 | view/labeler,
                    correlation = corAR1(form = ~ time_index | view),
                    data = monarch_thermal_data,
                    method = "REML")
