## Deployments
- Labeler should be another random variable
- Incorporate a "frame view" which is the section of the grove that is sampled. Multiple deployments can have the same frame view, or there can be just one. 
- Random effects are now frame view and labeler, not deployment

# Todo 
- [ ] Write concise statement of hypothesis
- [ ] Write concise statement of predictions
- [ ] Confirm analytical methods test those predictions 
- [ ] Think about how to analyze the second hypothesis (that they don't return)
- [ ] Write analytical methods this week
- [X] Polish V3
- [X] Check for additional content in V4
- [X] Write informal write up for the analytical thoughts
- [X] send stats class project to Francis
- [X] Send Francis Thesis link

## Hypotheses
- Strict hypothesis: 5 mph
- Loose hypothesis: Higher wind results in lower abundance
- Unsuitable habitat: don't return
- Light: Kiana's discussion: monarchs appear to be using the habitat that highest light
  - Bring it up in the introduction 

## Analysis
- Have a series of hypothesis specific models
- Then have a global model
- Title it intro
