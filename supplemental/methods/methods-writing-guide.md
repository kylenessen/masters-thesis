**Overall Structure and Organization:**

1.  **Clear Main Heading:** A distinct "METHODS" section.
2.  **Logical Subsections:**
    *   Methods are broken down into clearly titled, often numbered subsections (e.g., 3.1 Study Site, 3.2 Data Collection, 3.2.1 Live Trapping, 3.3 Data Analysis).
    *   The flow is generally:
        *   Description of the study system/site(s) and target organisms/phenomena.
        *   Detailed explanation of data collection procedures for each type of data.
        *   Description of data processing, preparation, and analytical techniques (including statistical methods and software).
3.  **Purposeful Introduction to Subsections:** Often, a subsection will begin by stating its objective or the specific hypothesis/question it addresses (e.g., "To test for evidence of selection...", "One objective is to compare...").

**Content and Detail:**

1.  **Justification and Rationale:**
    *   **Why a method was chosen:** Explanations are provided for why certain approaches, tools, or parameters were selected (e.g., "To ensure this assumption was not violated...", "Because large geographic extents can engender artificially inflated model results...", "To reduce the number of variables while still capturing variation...").
    *   **Citations for standard protocols/rationale:** Standard methods, software, or established ecological reasons for choices are often cited (e.g., citing Frey et al. for monarch count methods, MacKenzie et al. for occupancy models).
2.  **Sufficient Detail for Replicability:**
    *   **What was done:** Clear description of the actions performed.
    *   **How it was done:** Specifics are crucial. This includes:
        *   **Experimental/Sampling Design:** Details about plot layout, number of traps/cameras, spacing, timing, duration, and frequency of sampling.
        *   **Materials/Equipment:** Specific equipment is named (e.g., "Bushnell Trophy Cam HD Essential E3," "Sherman XL live traps," "YoloV5x," specific ear tags).
        *   **Protocols:** Step-by-step descriptions of procedures (e.g., baiting methods, trap checking times, animal processing, image labeling, camera setup).
        *   **Data Sources:** Precise origin of any existing datasets used (e.g., "Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation," "PRISM Climate Group," "National Hydrography Dataset," including version or year where relevant).
        *   **Software and Tools:** Specific software and packages are named, often with versions if significant (e.g., "ArcMap 10.8 (ESRI, 2020)," "R version 4.2.0," "unmarked package," "ENMeval").
3.  **Definitions and Classifications:**
    *   Key terms, custom classifications, or groupings used in the study are clearly defined (e.g., defining "island types" like I-OHV, I-NOHV; defining "scrub" vs. "willow" alliances; defining criteria for "Detailed" vs. "Approximate" polygons).
4.  **Data Handling and Processing:**
    *   Steps taken to clean, filter, transform, or prepare data for analysis are described (e.g., "Records missing Latitude or Longitude...were removed," "data were converted to occupancy data," "thinned points to one per raster cell," "cube-root transformed for normality").
5.  **Statistical Analysis Specificity:**
    *   **Tests Named:** Specific statistical tests are clearly stated (e.g., "Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction," "Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test," "Hotelling's T2," "repeated measures ANOVA").
    *   **Model Structure:** When models are used (e.g., occupancy models, SDMs), the structure is explained (e.g., "Probability of occupancy was modeled as a function of two station covariates... Probability of detection was modeled as a function of four observer covariates...").
    *   **Covariates:** All covariates included in models are listed and defined.
    *   **Model Selection/Averaging:** The criteria for model selection (e.g., AICc, QAICc, ΔQAICc ≤ 2.0) and any model averaging techniques are detailed.
    *   **Assumptions:** Mention of checking assumptions (e.g., goodness-of-fit tests, c-hat for overdispersion) and how violations were handled.
    *   **Type I Error:** If multiple comparisons are made, methods to control for Type I error (e.g., Bonferroni correction) are sometimes mentioned.

**Writing Style:**

1.  **Objective and Formal Tone:** The language is precise, scientific, and avoids colloquialisms.
2.  **Past Tense Predominantly:** Methods are described in the past tense as they report what *was* done.
3.  **Clarity and Precision:** Ambiguity is avoided. Sentences are constructed to convey exact meaning.
4.  **Focus on the "How" and "Why":** The methods section is not just a list of steps but explains the process and the reasoning behind it.

**In summary, your advisor appears to value a Methods section that is:**

*   **Well-structured and logically organized.**
*   **Highly detailed, providing enough information for another researcher to understand and potentially replicate the study.**
*   **Justified, explaining the rationale behind methodological choices, often with supporting citations.**
*   **Precise in its description of data sources, tools, procedures, and analytical steps.**
*   **Clear in defining terms and classifications specific to the study.**
*   **Written in a formal, objective, past-tense scientific style.**

- ALWAYS use paragraphs and avoid numbered or bulleted lists. If a section explicitly would benefit from an alternative format, suggest that as a comment
- Always review the text from a critical eye and make suggestions on how the writing can be strengthened or where it is confusing
- Provide comments wherever you see fit.
