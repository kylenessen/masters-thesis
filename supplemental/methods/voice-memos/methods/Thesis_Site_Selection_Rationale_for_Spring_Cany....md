# Thesis Site Selection Rationale (GitHub Issue #3)

## Overall Rationale & Selection Funnel

The primary justification for site selection is based on grant requirements and a logical filtering process, not an intrinsic comparison of the final two sites. The argument should be structured as a funnel:

1.  **Grant Requirement:** The project was supported by a federal grant, which mandated that the study be conducted on federal lands.
2.  **Vandenberg Selection:** Vandenberg was chosen as the federal land for the study. It contains a diversity of monarch overwintering habitats (30 named sites), including some of the best in California (some sites rank in the top 10%). It also offers the benefit of being a secure facility, which protects research equipment from tampering.
3.  **Initial Site Screening:** Of the 30 named sites on base, 12 were selected as potential locations due to their potential for supporting monarchs and providing year-round access.
4.  **Monitoring Period:** In total, 10 of these sites were monitored during the two-year study period.
5.  **Final Data-Producing Sites:** Due to low monarch populations during the study's overwintering seasons, only two sites produced measurable clusters suitable for this analysis: **Spring Canyon** and **UDMH**.

*Decision: Avoid getting into the weeds about the structural differences between the groves (e.g., naturalistic vs. anthropogenic). The funnel approach is a stronger, more direct justification.*

## Site Descriptions

### Spring Canyon

*   **Location:** South Base, within 800 ft of Space Launch Complex 4 (SLC-4).
*   **Significance:** Considered the most productive and reliable overwintering site on the base, frequently hosting some of the largest monarch clusters.
*   **Composition:** Consists entirely of over-mature Blue Gum (Eucalyptus globulus) trees, most of which are at least 120 ft (~40 meters) tall.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   A perennial creek runs through the center of the grove.
    *   A paved road intersects the creek. Many butterfly clusters were observed forming over this road, which created complications for equipment pole placement.

### UDMH

*   **Location:** South Base, adjacent to a secure waste facility from which the site likely gets its name.
*   **History:** A relatively new overwintering site.
*   **Composition:** Characterized by windrows of trees with a relatively clear understory.

## Action Items & Questions

- [ ] **Research:** Look up the size (area) of the Spring Canyon grove.
- [ ] **Research:** Confirm the name of the creek in Spring Canyon (is it Honda Creek?).
- [ ] **Research:** Look up when the UDMH site was first officially counted as an overwintering site.
- [ ] **Research:** Look up the size (area) of the UDMH grove.
- [ ] **Consult:** Ask Jessica what the acronym "UDMH" stands for.
- [ ] **Consult:** Ask Emma or Francis for the specific name/details of the federal grant supporting this project.
