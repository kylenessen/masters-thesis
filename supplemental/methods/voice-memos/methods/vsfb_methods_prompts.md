# VSFB Methods Section - Brainstorming Prompts

## Study Site Brainstorming Prompts

### Environmental Context
- What specific climatic conditions make VSFB suitable for monarchs? Think beyond "mild winters" - what are the temperature ranges, humidity levels, precipitation patterns?
- How do the eucalyptus groves at VSFB compare structurally to other major overwintering sites in California?
- What is the elevation range across your study sites, and does this create microclimatic variation?

### Site Selection Rationale
- Why exactly were Spring Canyon and UDMH the most successful sites? What specific characteristics distinguished them from the other eleven sites?
- How did the linear windbreak structure at UDMH versus the natural creek corridor at Spring Canyon potentially influence monarch behavior?
- What were the specific accessibility challenges that eliminated other potential sites?

## Field Equipment Brainstorming Prompts

### Equipment Positioning and Setup
- How did you determine the optimal distance range (4-17 meters) from clusters? What happens if you're closer or farther?
- What specific ground conditions influenced pole placement, and how did you ensure stability in different soil types?
- How did you minimize disturbance during initial setup when monarchs were already present?

### Camera Modification Technical Details
- Why specifically choose near-infrared over other wavelengths? What alternatives did you consider?
- How did you validate that your modifications were working correctly in the field?
- What backup procedures did you have if equipment failed during critical monitoring periods?

### Sampling Design Justification
- Why 10-minute intervals specifically? What did your preliminary tests show about butterfly movement patterns?
- How did you balance the trade-off between temporal resolution and equipment longevity?

## Image Analysis Brainstorming Prompts

### Grid System Development
- How did you determine the optimal grid cell size for different camera distances? What sizes didn't work and why?
- Why choose order-of-magnitude categories instead of more precise counts? What are the specific advantages?
- How did you validate that your grid system was capturing the relevant spatial variation in clustering?

### Protocol Validation
- How did you test inter-observer reliability? What was the agreement between different labelers?
- What were the most common classification errors, and how did you address them in training?
- How did you handle edge cases, like butterflies in flight or partially obscured individuals?

### Conservative Estimation Approach
- Why was it important to use minimum values rather than midpoints? How might this bias your results?
- How sensitive are your conclusions to this choice of conservative estimation?

## Overall Methods Clarity Issues to Address

### Missing Methodological Context
- You mention "strong wind events" as your focus, but you don't define what constitutes a "strong" wind event in your methods
- The connection between your 10-minute photo intervals and ability to detect responses to wind events needs clarification
- How did you synchronize wind measurements with abundance estimates temporally?

### Replication and Experimental Design
- How many deployments total did you have? This isn't clear from the current text
- What was your sampling unit for statistical analysis - individual photos, daily averages, deployment periods?
- How did you account for pseudoreplication when the same camera was reused across locations?

### Data Quality Control
- What procedures did you have for handling missing data due to equipment failure?
- How did you validate that your abundance indices actually reflected real changes in butterfly numbers?
- What quality control measures ensured consistent lighting and image quality across the season?

### Statistical Analysis Foundation
- You describe data collection but not how you'll analyze temporal patterns in relation to wind events
- How did you account for temporal autocorrelation in your abundance time series?
- What was your approach for handling the hierarchical structure of your data (photos within deployments within sites)?

## Key Areas for Strongest Impact

The strongest additions would come from addressing the "why" behind your methodological choices and providing more explicit connections between your equipment capabilities and your ability to answer your research questions about wind events and monarch behavior.

## Notes for Development

- Focus on justifying methodological choices rather than just describing them
- Connect each method to your specific research questions about wind effects
- Consider adding a methods flowchart or diagram to clarify the overall approach
- Ensure temporal synchronization between wind measurements and butterfly observations is clearly explained
