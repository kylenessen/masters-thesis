# Developing a Method to Test the Sunlight-Temperature Hypothesis

This session outlines the development of a hypothesis and analytical method to test the effect of direct sunlight and temperature on the abundance of overwintering monarch butterfly clusters.

## 1. Core Hypothesis & Prediction

*   **Observation**: Clusters more reliably disband or dissolve in response to prolonged, direct sunlight, particularly on warmer days.
*   **Mechanism**: Monarch metabolism scales non-linearly with temperature. They are incentivized to stay within a narrow thermal band and will change their behavior to cool down when overheated.
*   **Hypothesis**: Overwintering monarch butterflies are sensitive to overheating and will modify their behavior (i.e., disband clusters) in response to prolonged, direct exposure to sunlight.
*   **Prediction**: We will observe a negative change in monarch abundance correlated with greater sunlight exposure. This effect will have a significant interaction with ambient temperature, where the greatest negative changes in abundance will occur on days with both high ambient temperature and high direct sunlight.

## 2. Proposed Statistical Model

The model should mirror the structure of the existing "soft wind" analysis for consistency.

*   **Response Variable**: Change in monarch abundance (can be positive or negative).
*   **Predictors**:
    1.  **Sunlight Exposure**: A continuous variable representing the proportion of butterflies exposed to direct sunlight over the observation period (see Section 3).
    2.  **Ambient Temperature**: The appropriate metric needs to be determined (e.g., max temp, average temp, or change in temp over the interval).
    3.  **Interaction Term**: `Sunlight Exposure * Ambient Temperature`.
*   **Random Effects**: `Labeler` and `Field View`.
*   **Temporal Structure**: Include a temporal autocorrelation term (AR1).

## 3. Methodology & Data Processing

### Challenge 1: Quantifying Sunlight Exposure

A simple count of cells labeled "direct sunlight" is insufficient because it doesn't scale with the number of butterflies present.

*   **Proposed Solution: Cumulative Exposure Metric**
    *   Define a metric that calculates the proportion of butterflies experiencing direct sunlight over the entire observation period.
    *   **Calculation**: `(Sum of butterflies in direct sunlight across all frames) / (Sum of total butterflies across all frames)`
    *   **Outcome**: This produces a continuous variable between 0 and 1 that captures both the duration and magnitude of sunlight exposure relative to the population.
    *   **Potential Issue**: This metric will likely produce a zero-inflated distribution, as many observation periods will have no direct sunlight. This may require special handling in the statistical model.

### Challenge 2: Defining the Temporal Analysis Window

A full-day observation window could mask the effect, as clusters might disband in the morning sun and reform in the afternoon, resulting in zero net change.

*   **Proposed Solution: Split the Day**
    *   Divide the day into two distinct analysis periods (e.g., morning and afternoon).
    *   **Rationale**: This approach can isolate the morning period when clusters are most likely to disband due to initial sun exposure. This also provides a strong contrast, as many deployments are in foggy or shady conditions with no direct light. Analyzing morning vs. afternoon separately may also help disentangle the effects of wind, which is often stronger in the afternoon.
    *   **Justification Task**: Create a density plot of average wind speed by time of day to see if there is a clear pattern that supports splitting the day.

## 4. Action Items

1.  **Create GitHub Issue: Extract Temperature Data from Photos**
    *   **Task**: Write a Python script to process deployment photos.
    *   **Functionality**: The script should use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the temperature value from each image, record the associated filename, and save the output as a CSV.
    *   **Goal**: This CSV will be joined with the main dataset to add temperature as a predictor.

2.  **Perform Exploratory Analysis on Wind Data**
    *   **Task**: Generate a density plot of wind speed vs. time of day.
    *   **Goal**: Determine if splitting the day into morning/afternoon periods for the sunlight analysis is justified by a clear temporal wind pattern.
