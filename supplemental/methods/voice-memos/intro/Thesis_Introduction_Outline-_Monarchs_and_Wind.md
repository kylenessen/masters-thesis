# Master's Thesis: Introduction Outline

This is an outline for the introduction section of my master's thesis, based on feedback from Francis.

### 1. Broad Context: Abiotic Factors and Invertebrates

*   Start very wide: Invertebrate species are subject to both biotic and abiotic factors.
*   Focus on abiotic factors being particularly important for invertebrate species. List some of the ways abiotic factors influence invertebrates.
*   Introduce wind as a significant abiotic factor, referencing the papers I have collected.

### 2. Study System: The Monarch Butterfly

Monarch butterflies are an excellent system to study these effects for three key reasons:

1.  **Diverse Life History:** They have distinct breeding and non-breeding periods, famously characterized by their migration. Each life phase is subject to unique challenges from both biotic (e.g., milkweed availability, OE parasite) and abiotic (e.g., temperature) factors.
2.  **Charismatic Species:** They are a beloved and well-known species, which underscores the importance of the research.
3.  **Threatened Species:** They are a species in need of conservation, meaning that a better understanding of their biology should lead to better conservation outcomes.

### 3. Research Focus: The Overwintering Stage and Wind

*   The overwintering period, in particular, is a good phase for studying the effects of abiotic factors.
*   Describe the overwintering phase in a paragraph or so.
*   Discuss the current best science, specifically Kingston Leong's contributions to our understanding of monarch biology and the "microclimate hypothesis."
*   Focus on wind as a primary factor, citing Leong's statements. Argue that wind is a reasonable factor to study, citing other papers that show wind as an important abiotic factor for other insects.
*   **Justify Model Variables:** In this section, I need to describe and justify each of the variables that will be used in my model.
    *   Define and justify the fixed effects, such as sustained winds, gustiness, and light.
    *   Justify the response variable by citing Leong (2016), which states that above certain disruptive wind speeds, monarchs will either fly away or be dislodged. This directly justifies my chosen response variable.

### 4. Justification and Contribution

*   Establish that Leong's understanding of wind's impact has been highly influential in conservation management practices. Cite the Xerces Society management guide and other plans that rely on a specific wind threshold.
*   **Identify the Research Gap:** State clearly that the monarch's behavioral response to wind has never been directly or empirically studied. Leong inferred this relationship from wind measurements at roost versus non-roost trees but did not observe the butterflies' response to wind directly.
*   **State the Thesis Contribution:** My research provides the first empirical test of this foundational idea. Since a great deal of conservation management effort rests on the assumption that disruptive winds are detrimental to monarchs, knowing if that's true is a significant contribution. A better understanding of this relationship should improve our conservation practices. This section will lead into the hypotheses and methods.
