  Overall Impression

  The sequential three-step analysis is a very sound and defensible approach. It
  shows foresight by laying out a path from a specific, confirmatory test to a more
  exploratory analysis, which prevents the appearance of "p-hacking." The decision
  to drop the site fidelity and light hypotheses is also a mark of maturity;
  focusing on a clean, answerable question is far better than overextending your
  data.

  Detailed Feedback

  1. Framing and Narrative (Sections 1 & 2)

   * "The Disruptive Wind Hypothesis": I like this framing. It gives your core idea a
     memorable name. For clarity, I would suggest you explicitly state that you are
     naming it this for the purpose of your study, based on the concepts in Leong
     (2016). For example, "Based on this framework, we propose to test what we term
     the 'Disruptive Wind Hypothesis'..." This makes your contribution clear.
   * Critique of Leong: Your justification for the study is that Leong's 2 m/s
     threshold was inferred, not directly observed via behavioral response. This is
     your strongest point. I would make it even more explicit. You state it well, but
     you could enhance the power of that statement by briefly contrasting his methods
     (comparing occupied vs. unoccupied trees) with your own (continuous time-series
     observation of a single roost).
   * Confounding Variables: You do an excellent job introducing sunlight and
     temperature as confounding variables. This strengthens your experimental design
     immensely. Your methods.tex confirms you have the data to control for these,
     which is great.

  2. The Three-Step Analysis (Section 3)

  This is the core of your proposal and where I have the most substantive feedback.
  The logic is sound, but we need to be very careful about the statistical
  implementation.

   * Nature of the Response Variable (`abundance_change`): This is my most significant
     point of concern. Your methods.tex clearly states that your abundance data is an
     index calculated from order-of-magnitude bins (0, 1-9, 10-99, 100-999). This means
      your response variable is, fundamentally, not a continuous variable. Using a
     linear mixed-effects model (lme) assumes a continuous, normally-distributed
     response. A reviewer (or committee member) will immediately question this.
       * Recommendation: We need to discuss this. You might consider models designed
         for ordinal data (e.g., cumulative link mixed models, using ordinal::clmm) or
         treating the abundance index as count data and using a generalized linear
         mixed model (lme4::glmer) with a Poisson or Negative Binomial distribution.
         The latter might be tricky since it's an index, not a true count, but it's
         more appropriate than a standard linear model. This is a critical point we
         need to get right.

   * Step 1: Direct Test of the 2 m/s Threshold:
       * The predictor variables sustained_minutes_above_2ms and
         gust_minutes_above_2ms are interesting. They capture duration. Does a single
         30-minute period of wind above the threshold have the same effect as thirty
         1-minute events scattered over a day? Your variable implies "yes." Be
         prepared to defend this choice.
       * Testing them in separate models is the correct way to handle their
         collinearity. Good.

   * Step 2: General Wind-Abundance Relationship Model:
       * Major Issue: You have mean_wind_speed, max_wind_speed, and wind_speed_variance
          as predictors in the same model. These variables are very likely to be highly
          collinear. max_wind_speed will be correlated with mean_wind_speed, and both
         will influence wind_speed_variance. You cannot include them all in the same
         model; the results will be uninterpretable.
       * Recommendation: You should test these in separate models, just as you proposed
          for the threshold variables in Step 1. You can then use a model selection
         criterion (like AICc) to determine which aspect of wind (mean, max, or
         variance) is the best predictor.

   * Step 3: Predictive Hazard Model:
       * The term "Hazard Model" implies a time-to-event analysis (survival analysis).
         While your idea is conceptually similar, you are proposing a logistic
         regression on a binary outcome (roost_abandoned). I would re-label this
         "Predictive Roost Abandonment Model" or something similar to be more precise
         and avoid confusion.
       * The >90% drop threshold for defining an abandonment event feels a bit
         arbitrary. You should add a sentence justifying this choice. Is it based on
         literature, or a natural break you observed in the data? A quick look at the
         data to see the distribution of abundance changes might help justify this
         cutoff.

  3. Dropped Hypotheses (Section 4)

   * Your reasoning here is excellent. I fully support this. It shows you understand
     the limitations of your data and are focused on delivering a robust, defensible
     result. We can always mention the site fidelity question in your discussion
     section as a key area for future research using different methods (e.g.,
     mark-recapture or telemetry).

  4. Ancillary Analysis: Rocket Launches (Section 5)

   * This is a fantastic, opportunistic side-project. It's the kind of unique dataset
     that can lead to a very interesting short-note publication. Your proposed analysis
      is simple and appropriate. I agree this should be kept separate from the main
     thesis chapters unless the results are unexpectedly dramatic. Keep it in your back
      pocket.

  Summary & Next Steps

  This is a very promising draft. The project is well-conceived and addresses a
  clear gap in the literature.

  Before you proceed, please focus on these key points:

   1. Address the statistical model choice. We must find a model that is appropriate
      for your binned abundance index. This is the most critical change needed.
   2. Fix the collinearity issue in the Step 2 analysis by planning to run separate
      models for each wind metric.
   3. Refine the terminology for the "Hazard Model" and add a justification for the 90%
      threshold.
   4. Slightly enhance the narrative in the introduction to make your critique of prior
      work and your contribution even more explicit.

  Let's discuss the statistical modeling issue in our next meeting. Please come with
  some thoughts on how we might approach that. Otherwise, this is excellent progress.
   Keep it up.
