## Hypotheses and Predictions

### Hypothesis 1: The Disruptive Wind Hypothesis
**Hypothesis:** Wind acts as a disruptive force that causes monarch butterflies to leave their overwintering roosts.

**Prediction 1a (Threshold Model):** If winds above 2 m/s are disruptive as proposed by Leong (2016), then monarch abundance at a roost will decrease following exposure to sustained winds or gusts exceeding this threshold.

**Prediction 1b (Continuous Model):** If wind disruption varies continuously with wind speed rather than at a discrete threshold, then monarch abundance will show a negative relationship with wind speed metrics (mean, maximum, or variance), with stronger winds causing greater decreases in abundance.

### Hypothesis 2: The Roost Abandonment Hypothesis  
**Hypothesis:** Disruptive winds increase the probability of complete roost abandonment events.

**Prediction 2:** If wind influences roost abandonment probability, then the likelihood of observing a major abundance decrease (>90% reduction) will increase with higher wind speeds, following a probabilistic relationship that can be modeled using the most influential wind metric identified in Hypothesis 1.

### Hypothesis 3: The Site Fidelity Hypothesis (*conditional test*)
**Hypothesis:** Disruptive wind events reduce monarch site fidelity to overwintering roosts.

**Prediction 3:** If disruptive winds affect site fidelity, then roosts experiencing wind-induced dispersal events will show delayed or incomplete recovery of abundance compared to pre-dispersal levels, indicating that displaced butterflies do not fully return to the original roost site.

---

**Note on confounding variables:** All predictions will be tested while controlling for the confounding effects of sunlight exposure and ambient temperature, which are known drivers of monarch activity and dispersal behavior. These variables will be included as an interaction term in our models (see Methods for analytical details).

**Note on Hypothesis 3:** This hypothesis will only be tested if Hypothesis 1 is supported, as it represents a secondary consequence of wind disruption. Given our inability to track individual butterflies, this test makes the conservative assumption that any failure to return to pre-dispersal abundance levels indicates reduced site fidelity.

## Hypotheses and Predictions
To investigate the effects of wind on overwintering monarch butterflies, we structured our inquiry around a series of general hypotheses and their specific, testable predictions. This framework allows us to first test a historically significant threshold and then explore the relationship between wind and monarch abundance more broadly.

### Hypothesis 1: The Disruptive Wind Hypothesis

A disruptive wind is a condition that causes monarch butterflies to abandon their overwintering roosts. This hypothesis posits that a general phenomenon of "disruptive wind" exists and elicits an abandonment response.

Prediction 1: Based on the established literature, we predict that our monarch abundance index will show a negative correlation with the amount of time wind speeds exceed the 2 m/s threshold. Specifically, we expect to observe a decrease in the abundance index at roosts exposed to winds above this speed.

### Hypothesis 2: The Dose-Response Hypothesis

The magnitude of the roost abandonment response is proportional to the intensity of the disruptive wind. This hypothesis suggests that not all disruptive winds are equal and that stronger winds will elicit a stronger response.

Prediction 2: We predict that there will be a negative relationship between our wind metrics (mean speed, maximum gust, and variance) and our monarch abundance index. As the values of these wind metrics increase, we expect to see a correspondingly larger decrease in the abundance index.

### Hypothesis 3: The Roost Abandonment Probability Hypothesis

The probability of a catastrophic roost abandonment event increases with the intensity of a disruptive wind. This hypothesis focuses on the likelihood of large-scale dispersal events rather than incremental decreases in abundance.

Prediction 3: We predict that the probability of a roost abandonment event—defined as a decline in the abundance index greater than an order of magnitude between consecutive measurements—will be positively correlated with our wind metrics. Higher wind speeds will increase the likelihood of observing such an event.

## Hypotheses and Predictions

### Hypothesis 1 (Disruptive wind exists): There is a class of wind conditions that disrupts overwintering monarch roosting behavior, resulting in reductions in local roost abundance.
Predictions tailored to this study:
1A. Threshold prediction: If disruptive wind is well-approximated by a fixed physical threshold, then minutes exceeding a 2 m/s threshold (evaluated separately for sustained wind and gusts) will be negatively associated with the monarch abundance index at the next observation, after accounting for temporal dependence and confounding by sunlight and temperature (see Methods).
1B. Magnitude prediction: If disruptiveness scales with wind magnitude, then stronger winds (higher sustained means, higher maximum gusts) will be associated with larger decreases in the abundance index across observation intervals (see Methods).
1C. Variability/turbulence prediction: If gustiness contributes to disruptiveness, then higher within-interval wind variance will be negatively associated with the abundance index, beyond mean speed effects (see Methods).
1D. Timescale prediction: If the disruptive process can be acute and/or cumulative, then negative wind–abundance associations will be detectable at short (e.g., 30-minute) and/or aggregated (e.g., multi-hour, daily) temporal scales, with effect sizes indicating whether acute events or longer exposure dominate (see Methods).

### Hypothesis 2 (Wind-dependent abandonment risk): The probability of extreme roost depletion (abandonment) increases with disruptive wind conditions.
Predictions tailored to this study:
2A. Risk curve prediction: The probability of an abandonment event (defined a priori as a large drop in the abundance index over a monitoring interval; see Methods) will increase monotonically with the most informative wind metric identified under Hypothesis 1.
2B. Management threshold prediction: If a practical management threshold exists, then the risk curve will exhibit a detectable inflection or rapid increase over a narrow range of wind values, providing an operational guideline even if the exact 2 m/s threshold is not supported (see Methods).

### Hypothesis 3 (Wind reduces short-term site fidelity at a roost): Disruptive winds reduce short-term roost fidelity, producing sustained decreases in local abundance beyond immediate displacement.
Predictions tailored to this study (secondary/conditional):
3A. Next-day retention prediction: On days following disruptive wind conditions that caused large within-day declines, next-day abundance will remain depressed relative to pre-event levels, after controlling for diurnal patterns and weather (see Methods).
3B. Order-of-magnitude prediction: If loss of fidelity is strong, then events with extreme wind exposure will be followed by order-of-magnitude declines that are not fully recovered by the next day (see Methods).
Note: Hypothesis 3 will be evaluated only if Hypothesis 1 is supported and data permit conservative definition and detection of short-term fidelity signals.

How these map to the stepwise analysis
Step 1 evaluates Prediction 1A directly (fixed 2 m/s threshold; sustained vs. gust minutes).
Step 2 evaluates Predictions 1B–1D (continuous wind metrics and timescales) and identifies the most informative wind metric.
Step 3 evaluates Predictions 2A–2B (abandonment risk as a function of the wind metric from Step 2).
Conditional analyses address Predictions 3A–3B if warranted by results from Steps 1–2.
