Chapter 1: Vegetation and Habitat Fragmentation Predict Occupancy by Small Mammal Species in Coastal Dunes with Off-Highway Vehicular Recreation
1.1 Introduction
Understanding the landscape factors that govern species distributions is an essential component of successful wildlife and habitat management. Terrestrial species distributions are driven by a variety of habitat characteristics, including vegetation community and structure, habitat connectivity, and anthropogenic land use and disturbance. For example, bird communities have been shown to be influenced by a combination of vegetation structure, connectivity, and anthropogenic use in varying ways in green spaces across urban landscapes. Similar to species occurring in urban landscapes, species occurring in habitats that are impacted by anthropogenic recreation are likely to be constrained by their own species-specific habitat requirements, impacts of habitat fragmentation, and the anthropogenic disturbance associated with human use.




Here we are interested in the hypothetical effect of multiple attributes on the distribution of species occurring within a habitat that supports recreation. Though the negative impacts of recreation are generally recognized, such as through the analysis of flight distance, the impact of specific types of recreation have been harder to discern. Efforts to disentangle the various co-occurring effects of human disturbance, like fragmentation from recreational activity, are rare, especially in non-charismatic vertebrates. An additional complication is that human disturbance through ecotourism or recreation, can lead directly to environmental degradation of native vegetation as people move through the landscape they use for recreation. Taken to a high enough level, the degradation of vegetated habitat would ultimately lead to habitat fragmentation. Thus, it is difficult to discern if habitat fragmentation, specific recreation related disturbance, or collateral habitat degradation are impacting species distributions, all within the context of species-specific habitat affinities.





We explored effects of these attributes on the distribution of species occurring within a habitat that supports recreation at the Oceano Dunes State Vehicular Recreation Area (ODSVRA) in coastal California. The area is composed of native vegetation with dunes that are subject to natural habitat fragmentation, but where some of the fragmentation is also maintained by off-highway vehicular (OHV) recreation, which is the specific anthropogenic recreation we considered. Importantly, the OHV recreation occurs around but not within the habitat fragments. Meaning we can control for (eliminate) the degradation of vegetative habitat within fragments. Therefore, we consider the impact of species-specific habitat affinities, habitat fragmentation, and off-highway vehicular (OHV) recreation, while controlling for within fragment vegetation degradation.





Given their high abundance, we address multiple species-specific responses in a small mammal community. Small mammals are ubiquitous with high reproductive output and therefore have large numbers of individuals available for monitoring. Additionally, small mammals can respond quickly to changes in the environment, allowing quick inferences through their study. For active land management, these characteristics allow large data sets to be produced in practical time spans with reasonable effort, providing insights into the influence of habitat characteristics on species distributions. We had sufficient detections for occupancy analyses of six small mammal species found in the coastal central California at ODSVRA, which we were able to use to understand how vegetation community and structure, habitat fragmentation, and human recreational OHV disturbance influence the small mammal's occupancy.





1.1.2 Hypotheses and Predictions
Using known species-specific ecology, we formed hypotheses and predictions regarding the influence of vegetation alliance, fragmentation, and recreation on each species' probability of occurrence. Summarized hypotheses and predictions are shown in Table 1.


We hypothesized occupancy would vary across dominant vegetation alliances for all species, except 

P. maniculatus, a known generalist. We predicted higher occupancy in scrub for 

D. heermanni given their preference for sparse, low vegetation that allows for bipedal locomotion. 

C. californicus would have higher predicted occupancy in scrub, reflecting habitat associations with semiarid shrublands, open woodland, and herbaceous plant seed diet. 

M. californicus occupancy was predicted to be higher in scrub given a common dietary association with graminoids, sedges, and forbs. Predicted occupancy would be higher in willow for 

N. macrotis and P. californicus, given P. californicus is semi-arboreal and occurs in dense chaparral and broad-sclerophyll woodland and N. macrotis occurs in mesic oak and chaparral woodlands and uses woody plant material for midden construction.

Considering fragmentation, we hypothesized that occupancy would vary across the fragmentation types for some species, but not all. Known 

C. californicus ecology led to any a priori predictions. We predicted occupancy would not vary by fragmentation category (NI and I) for 

D. heermanni and P. maniculatus, due to use of dirt roads (low, sparce or absent vegetation) for dispersal by kangaroo rats and a distribution of P. maniculatus across various habitat types (suggesting dispersal regardless of matrix). For the remaining species, we predicted occupancy would vary by fragmentation category (NI and I). We predicted 


M. californicus occupancy would be greatest on NI-NOHV, given their cyclic population fluctuations, need to recolonize following local extinction, and presumed avoidance of unvegetated matrix given their diet. 

N. macrotis females typically disperse less than 100 meters from their natal midden so we predicted occupancy would be greatest on NI-NOHV (inferring rare dispersal from areas of high cover). The prediction for 

P. californicus follows that of N. macrotis, given they are semi-arboreal and have an association (non-obligate) with the woody middens of woodrats (genus Neotoma).

We hypothesized that occupancy would vary as a function of human recreational disturbance (OHV vs NOHV) for all species and predicted that I-OHV would have the lowest occupancy due to disturbance associated with OHV activity.
