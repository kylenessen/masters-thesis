# Master's Thesis Discussion: Monarch Clustering Behavior

## Primary Finding: Wind Hypothesis Not Supported

The central finding of my study is that it does not support the disruptive wind hypothesis put forward by Kingston and Leong. Even with the study's limitations, if the wind hypothesis were true, we should have observed a signal. A change from some butterflies to zero is a reliable signal, and this is what is strictly predicted by the hypothesis at the 2 meters/second threshold widely adopted by the conservation community.

My data shows no strong evidence of changes in Monarch abundance, even up to wind speeds of 12 meters/second—six times the proposed threshold. We observed no change, small changes, or even positive changes at these high wind speeds. If the methodology were flawed, we wouldn't have seen the strong response from other variables like light. We would have expected a figure for maximum wind speed similar to the one for direct sunlight, but instead, we got a flat line, indicating it doesn't seem to matter on short time scales.

## Study Limitations and Counterarguments

There are certainly limitations to my study that should be acknowledged.

1.  **Limited Scope:** The data comes from a single year and only a few spots within a single grove. This was compounded by my second year of monitoring being a historically low year where no butterfly clustering was observed at all.

2.  **Different Era:** The monarch counts during my study year were much lower than in the early 1990s when Kingston and Leong first formulated the wind hypothesis.

3.  **Counting Method:** My counting method creates some unusual artifacts in the modeling structure and results in some loss of resolution in the count and time interval. This was a necessary trade-off to balance the immense labeling effort against the signal resolution. We tried to find a sweet spot that made data collection feasible with available resources while still capturing changes on a relevant time scale.

4.  **Low Explanatory Power (R-squared):** The best model does not explain a large proportion of the variance in the response variable. My response to this is that the study was not designed to definitively understand all short-term movement in monarch butterflies. It was designed to explicitly test the wind hypothesis. There is still a lot we don't understand about why monarchs choose the spots they do or what causes them to move.

## Alternative Drivers of Monarch Movement

Our results suggest that managing body temperature, diurnal patterns, and perhaps more stochastic processes are more influential in the short-term movements of overwintering butterflies.

### Thermoregulation and Diurnal Rhythms
Maintaining thoracic body temperature within a certain range is an important function for overwintering butterflies, an idea supported by previous literature and this project. There's reason to think that monarchs leaving or joining clusters has to do with thermoregulation. For example, butterfly numbers increased at sites up to about 20°C.

Interestingly, direct sunlight was one of the strongest predictors of a *negative* change—the more butterflies in direct sunlight, the larger the decrease in numbers. This can be interpreted as butterflies that were in direct sun at the beginning of an interval simply left. This aligns with papers showing that even 10 minutes in direct sunlight can raise their thoracic body temperatures to a point where they must modify their behavior.

This helps resolve a mystery. I initially thought sunning was bad because it causes them to leave, based on the "lipid budget hypothesis" where they try to conserve energy. So why would they evolve a physiology to absorb sunlight so efficiently? A potential answer is that it facilitates a daily rhythm. We observed a clear diurnal pattern, even after controlling for other variables: more butterflies in the morning, leaving as it warms up, and gone by midday. The ability to warm up rapidly in sunlight gives them the opportunity to engage in this daily activity.

### Stochastic Processes and "Seeding" Behavior
Monarch clustering locations might be more stochastic than we previously gave them credit for. It's possible that if one butterfly lands in a spot, it's more likely that another will join it rather than select a new spot. This creates a positive feedback loop where a cluster is much more likely to attract more butterflies than a smaller cluster or no cluster at all. This stochastic process could make it difficult to model short-term movement at a particular location based on my variables.

## The Predictability of Light as a Guiding Factor

Monarchs tend to find the same spots—even the same branches—year after year. Given the genetic mixing of the population, it seems unlikely this is genetically encoded information. It's more likely a refined algorithm for site selection.

A key problem with the wind hypothesis is that you can only know which spots are protected *during* a windstorm; it's difficult to predict ahead of time. Light, however, is very predictable. The pattern of light and shadow created by canopy cover is stable throughout a season and from year to year. A monarch's compound eye seems well-suited to assessing canopy cover and light patterns.

## Conclusions

Wind is not a primary factor in determining the short-term movements of monarch butterflies. Instead, thermoregulation, diurnal patterns, and stochastic clustering processes appear to be more influential.

## Recommendations for Future Work

1.  **Test the Light Hypothesis:** Future work should explicitly test if the pattern of light predicts where monarchs choose to cluster.

2.  **Investigate Social Dynamics:** Research should explore if a social, emergent property is at play, where a "seed" of a few butterflies creates a positive feedback loop attracting more.

3.  **Define Suitable Habitat:** We need to better understand what constitutes a suitable roost location for monarch butterflies, with a particular focus on the role of light.

## Management Implications

These findings suggest we should not manage primarily for the wind protection of cluster sites. The honest answer is that we still have much to learn, so we must conserve our dwindling overwintering sites. However, this opens the door to new ideas.

*   **Rethinking Habitat:** There may be more potential habitat within existing groves than previously thought. This could inform modifications like strategically opening up canopies, as done by Kingston and Leong, and exploring innovative solutions beyond problematic species like blue gum eucalyptus.

*   **Focus on Large Trees:** Large trees are clearly important. We should manage for the health of existing trees and continue planting the next generation. A sound strategy would be to plant large trees at the highest density that can be supported for healthy, long-lived growth. It is much easier to remove a tree than to grow one.

*   **Re-evaluating Past Actions:** While past management efforts may have been aimed at managing for wind, they had the beneficial side effect of planting more trees at high densities. So, while the reasoning may have been different, the recommendations to plant and care for trees are still valid.

## Closing Thoughts

Monarch butterflies are one of the most iconic insects in the world, and their migration is world-famous. In coastal California, we are privileged to witness this remarkable phenomenon. The long-term conservation of their overwintering habitat is critically important, not only for the butterfly's life cycle but also as a source of pride for those of us who get to enjoy and steward these lands.

## Raw Audio Transcript

Okay, this is a brainstorm of um, my discussion for my master's thesis. It m. So the big thing. Of. Course is um, my study does not support the wind disruptive wind hypothesis put forward by Kingston Leong. Um, there's certainly limitations of ah, my study. Uh, I don't know where the limitations go, but something we're talking about. So um, an obvious limitation of the study. Was. That uh, I only have data from a single year and really just a few spots within a single grove. Again, that's, that's partly because my second year of monitoring historically low year. No. Clustering butterflies were observed of Annenberg. My second year. And um, even the year I did get data, it is different um, than when Kings and Liang put forth his hypotheses. You know, so he first formulated this wind idea in the early 90s. And. Um, during that time Monarch counts were much higher than they were today. Uh, there's also the limitation of my counting method which um, crates some unusual artifacts in the modeling structure and there's some loss. Of. Resolution, you know, in terms of like the count and the time interval. Um, but this was done in an effort to balance labeling effort versus versus um, like signal or like the full resolution of what could be observed. You know, I don't think I need to say this, but from the spectrum. Of. Literally just watching real time video of butterflies versus taking counts like every month or something, you know, try to find a, a band or a um, sweet spot that made it feasible to collect data with the resources available while also um, maximizing the um, response time, um, trying to make that time difference as close as possible. Okay, uh, other limitations of my study. Yeah, this, this study would like benefit from future work, would certainly benefit from expanding similar types of work, uh, across more groves, across a wider latitudinal gradient, you know, in um, higher abundance areas. All those sorts of things would certainly strengthen the conclusions that this paper is drawing. But even with these limitations, if the hypotheses presented about wind were true, we should still see a signal because zero butterflies are. Oh come on. Are readily detected. Changes from sign butterflies to zero butterflies is a reliable signal of the study and that is what is predicted, um, in a very strict manner. Right. 2 meters per second is the threshold that was proposed by Kings and Leong, um, and widely adopted by the Monarch conservation community. Uh, the fact that we do not observe, uh, the fact that we do not observe changes or statistic or. Yeah, I mean this data shows like not strong evidence of changes in Monarch abundance like even up to 12 meters per second, you know, six times. Yeah. We'Re observing no change or small changes even up to positive changes, even up to 12 meters per second. Come on. Hey, hey, come here. Just look at of all. It. Um, you know, another obvious limitation of this study is that the best model does not explain a large proportion of the variance within the response variable. And. Wow, that is a terrible spot. Angus. And my response to the low uh, R squared value is uh, essentially that there's still a lot we don't understand. Yeah, the study was not designed to definitively understand short term movement in monarch butterflies. Hey. Um, it was designed to uh, test this wind hypothesis uh, explicitly, you know, with other, with other variables. Rodan can just help bring some flavor. So I guess the short answer is we don't totally know why monarchs choose the spots they do or what causes them to move. It could be, could be random. You know, they could be clustering at other parts of the grove. Um, could propose other hypotheses that monarch butterflies um, cluster locations might be more stochastic than we previously gave them credit for. You know, maybe there's this idea. Of. A seed like a butterfly is seeded. I'm not explaining this very well. Basically like if one butterfly lands in a spot, it's more likely that another butterfly will join it at its spot than to select a new spot. And so then you can get this positive feedback loop. Where um, you know. A cluster of butterflies is much more likely to attract more butterflies than no cluster at all or even a smaller cluster. And so this clustering behavior could be. There could be lots of uh, potentially split suitable habitat within a grove. And the diurnal movements of these monarchs um, can follow this stochastic process, uh, which would make it difficult to model short term movement at a particular location. Uh based on my variable is not low. And I think what um, my study also points to is the clear. Well. You know, further support. I think that um, maintaining thoracic body temperature is within a certain range is an important function function of uh, overwhelming butterflies. And it seems and that idea is supported with previous literature and I think it's supported in this project as well. Where um, where. Thermo behavioral. Well. There'S reason to think that the monarchs are uh, leaving or growing these different spots. Uh, has to do with. Yeah, I mean like there's a optimum. So there's like the butterflies are increasing to about 20 degrees Celsius at sites where the temperature is warmer and decreasing within those sites too. And direct sunlight, you know, based on previous Literature where. Hey. No, no, come. On. Hey, come on. Hey. I know it's a weird sound m temperature. You know, like you see a pattern that kind of makes sense, but then the direct sunlight is like one of the strongest predictors of negative change. The more butterflies, uh, that are in direct sunlight, the more, uh, bigger a change you expect to see. And. Yeah. Which can be interpreted as butterflies that were in direction line at the beginning, just left. And there's great papers, um, showing that even just a few minutes, like 10 minutes or so in direct sunlight, these butterflies can reach, um, really high thoracic body temperatures to the point where they need to modify their behavior. Um, I think what is also interesting. Come on. Which may help resolve this mystery that I had about this, um, the sunning behavior. So. You know, originally I was coming into this idea that sunning is bad for monarch butterflies because it causes them to leave. Um, but Francis pushed back quite a bit, suggesting, like, oh, this is always thought of as a good thing because in Kiana's study, and I found a similar conclusion, that sunlight, or the variability of sunlight is how I interpreted it was associated with, um, monarch preference. It. Um. Okay. Anyway, so, yeah, I was, I was confused about that. Right. Because it raises their body temperature. I was operating from this, like, the bid budget hypothesis, which is, I think. Um. Not the complete picture, but certainly component of it, which is monarchs will have a particular burn rate on lipids. And that burn rate, of course, varies with behavior and also thoracic body temperature. And so my thought was that they're just trying to save energy and staying at a particular temperature would be good. Uh, so then why would monarchs, uh, seemingly have evolved, uh, physiology that allows them to absorb sunlight, um, very efficiently to raise their body temperature? That was the mystery. And the answer, a potential answer to that is there are, um, diurnal patterns, there's a rhythm, um, to monarch changes in abundance, um, even after you control for temperature and all the other variables. And it's pretty, pretty standard. They'll. There's more in the morning, and then they leave as it warms up, gone in the midday evening. And that's something that's been observed in the past. Anecdotally, the, uh, pattern seems reasonably clear with my data. And so if butterflies, for whatever reason, uh, want to engage, okay, in this. Uh, daily rhythm. Then this ability to warm up rapidly in sunlight gives them an opportunity to do that. And this sunlight metric, now that I'm thinking about a little bit more. Um. Is actually quite interesting because. Temperature. Decide temperature regime is Largely chosen by where they choose to overwinter. So that's the macro selection. Crystal level, grove. And then, you know, once you're in the grove, it's, you know, at a local, um, time scale, you can pick a spot that is seen warmer than other spots. But. You know, to, like, put it in Peter's words, you know, like, air is just air. Air temperature is what it is, doesn't really change. So if you wanted, you know, if you want differences, an apparent temperature, then you have to incorporate direct sunlight. And, you know, there's this mystery about monarchs where, you know, they tend to find these same spots year after year, same branches, same parts of the tree. And because there's a. An obvious and, like, tremendous amount of mixing. Let's go this way. Come on. More monarchs, uh, east and west seem to be interconnected. Just a big sloshy ball of genetic material. To me, it seems very far more unlikely that there's some, like, genetically encoded information to go to a particular branch at Pismo. Instead, I think there's probably, um, very well refined algorithms that have different programmatic layers, one that assesses, I suppose, a decision to continue to migrate or not. You know, this is the landscape level searching of overwintering groves and then a fine scale algorithm, um, which ass. Okay, now that I've. Now that I found a spot that I think is good, where should I, um, cluster? And, you know, one of the problems with this wind hypothesis is that you can't. You can only know where. Come on. I guess we're really protected spots are during an actual wind storm. And if it's. Come on. Come on, come on. It. Damn it. When I lost that thought. It's very frustrating. Thank you, Angus. I think the idea I was leaning to was you can't know ahead of time what wind protection will be. Support that, right, by saying, you know, wind is even very difficult for us to predict. But light. That's what I'm trying to get to. Light is very. Predictable. You can, you know, we can make very reliable measures of canopy cover using, um, fairly simple cameras. The eye of a monarch butterfly is already kind of set up for this pattern. Um. Come on. Yeah, like with our brains, we have. Come on. Hey, come on. I don't know, maybe it's similar, but I'm just thinking we have essentially one camera, a lot of one lens, um, a lot of, um, nerves, the back of our eye to collect that information. Whereas monarchs have a compound eye. I can imagine a way of just bending all those signals to approximate some cover. Hike it and I think. Oh yeah. So the, I guess the idea here is the pattern of light. The pattern of light is very stable not just throughout the season, uh, but from year to year. And, and. You know arguably like decade to decade trees are fairly slow growing unless like major branches fall. The relative like canopy structure stays more or less the same. And so maybe light since it is. A. I think the, the strongest and clearest signal of monarch behavior. I think that's also helpful to the argument too. Like uh, you know, if there's a problem with the methodology we wouldn't have seen a strong signal. Oh, I'm missing a figure too. Yeah. If the method failed was not working we wouldn't have seen this like strong response from light. And uh, because we did indicates me right that it works. And you know, if the hypothesis was true then we should have seen a similar graph. So you. Okay. You expect a similar figure for maximum wind speed that we got from um, direct sunlight. But uh, we didn't. We got a flat line kind of indicating that it doesn't seem to matter. It means like short time scales. It. Okay. So yeah. What's, what's the final conclusion? Um. Wind. Wind not Is not an important. Wind is not a factor in determining the short term movements of monarch butterflies. Our results suggest that managing managing body temperature, diurnal patterns of movement and perhaps more stochastic processes that have been previously described are more influential in these like the short term movements of overwintering butterflies. Uh, future work, Future work should investigate if light should more explicitly test the pattern of light. Perfect predicts where monarchs overwinter or seek clustering locations. And in addition is there a biological like social emergent property also at play where there is a positive feedback loop of overwintering butterflies? Um, a seed or a few butterflies lead to more or seed to more or see to more like a kind of gravity or do they um, cluster randomly which we don't have a lot of reason to think that and maybe there's a lot more. This is a good thought. So maybe there's a lot more potential habitat than has been previously thought. So that leads to management implications which suggests that we should not manage for the wind protection of cluster uh sites Hard stop according to Francis. Maybe the honest answer is we don't know and we should try to conserve our dwindling reserves of overwintering sites in California and Mexico as much as possible and some more information can be learned. Future uh work should try to better understand what is suitable habitat. What is a suitable roost location for monarch butterflies, we recommend investigating light in particular as that uh, may. Um, as. That may reassure us, you know, you know, and understanding there is, there's more space within our existing groves than we immediately give them credit. May inform modifications to groves, um, such as opening up canopies as done by Kingston Leong. And potentially um, leaving the door open for more innovative ideas, more out of the box ideas that may not require um, solutions of the past like using glue gums which are a problematic species. It's m. Um, I'm not exactly sure how to make this argument but. You. Know, it's not the focus of the study. But within our study, cluster heights range from this to this. The stable clusters occurred. The largest, most stable cluster occurred generally within openings in the center of canopy of existing forest structure. Um, looking at our extensive record of overwintering sites, you know, large trees seem to be important and so we should manage for the care of these trees and we should continue to plant these trees um, as they, as our current ones senescence and die, you know, starting the next generation of habitat for monarch butterflies. So I, you know, if anything uh, you know, if I'm just asked uh, to speculate right now I would plant at the highest density of large trees you think you could support, you know, that would make healthy long lived trees. Um, now and as we learn more we can remove those trees. It's much easier to remove a tree than to grow a tree. And so while it's a little bit of saving grace, but while I think previous, um, while some of the stories I guess or the understanding of why we did what we did in the past, we may have been aiming or we may have been thinking we've been aiming at one thing, but we still hit the thing we needed to hit. Talking in circles right now, but while we were trying to manage for wind, you know, manage for wind had the side benefit of just planting more trees again at these like higher densities. It is still true that it's easier to remove a tree than it is to grow one. Even, even though I know removing trees are expensive, um, you can't pay more money to make a tree grow faster. And so I think previous recommendations are still valid. Um, but we were just optimizing for something else. Yeah, it. And then just some drafts like closing thoughts, you know. Monarch butterflies are one of the most iconic insects in the world. Their migration is world famous. And in coastal California we're very privileged to be able to see this remarkable phenomenon play out every fall and winter while the trees, they predominantly cluster on have their controversies. They are also considered beautiful and part of California's character. The long term continued conservation of overwintering habitat um, is therefore not only vital and critically important, um, coming at a critically important stage in the life cycle or the annual phase of monarch butterfly biology. It's also a um, source of pride for us California, for us, for us. Those um, get to enjoy these species and uh, steward their land. And with that I think I have got a lot of good thoughts.
