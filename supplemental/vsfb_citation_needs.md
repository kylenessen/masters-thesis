## Introduction (chapters/vsfb/introduction.tex)

### Monarch Migration and Life History

**Lines 14-15:** "North American monarchs complete an annual cycle through a remarkable multi-generational migration that links vast northern breeding ranges with small, highly specific overwintering sites (REF). The continent is home to two populations separated by the Rocky Mountains: a larger Eastern population and a Western population (REF)."
- Need: Basic reference for monarch migration overview
- Need: Reference for Eastern vs Western population division

**Lines 15-16:** "During the spring and summer, multiple short-lived generations of butterflies (2--5 weeks) breed throughout North America, with females laying eggs exclusively on milkweed (\textit{Asclepias} spp.), the larval host plant (REF)."
- Need: Citation for generation length during breeding season
- Need: Citation for milkweed as exclusive host plant

**Lines 16-17:** "This breeding phase builds the population as they radiate northward, but as late summer approaches, environmental cues such as shortening day length and cooling temperatures trigger the shift to the migratory generation (REF)."
- Need: Citation for environmental cues triggering migration

**Lines 17-18:** "These migratory adults exhibit a unique phenotype: they enter a state of reproductive diapause (suspended reproduction) and possess elongated wings suited for long-distance travel (REF)."
- Need: Citation for reproductive diapause and morphological changes in migratory generation

**Lines 19-20:** "The fall migration begins as these long-lived adults (6--8 months) orient themselves southward, flying up to thousands of kilometers, a journey fueled by energy stored as lipid reserves accumulated from nectaring flowers along their route (REF)."
- Need: Citation for lifespan of migratory generation
- Need: Citation for lipid reserves and nectaring behavior

**Lines 20-21:** "Navigational feats are guided by a sophisticated system that includes a time-compensated sun compass residing in the antennae, allowing them to maintain direction throughout the day (REF)."
- Need: Citation for sun compass navigation mechanism

**Lines 21-22:** "Eastern monarchs travel to the high-altitude oyamel fir (\textit{Abies religiosa}) forests in central Mexico, while the Western population migrates to overwintering groves located along the Pacific coast of California (REF)."
- Need: Citation for overwintering site locations for both populations

### Overwintering Physiology

**Line 23:** "During these months, monarchs must survive exclusively on lipid reserves accumulated during autumn migration while maintaining precise thermoregulatory balance"
- Already cited (chaplinEnergyReservesMetabolic1982, mastersMonarchButterflyDanaus1988)

**Lines 23-24:** "As ectotherms, monarchs face a fundamental trade-off: they must maintain body temperatures cool enough to conserve energy through metabolic suppression, yet warm enough to permit essential daily movement (REF)."
- Need: General citation for ectotherm thermoregulation trade-offs in monarchs

### Management and Conservation

**Line 27:** "restoration efforts (REF)"
- Need: Specific examples of restoration efforts implementing wind protection

**Lines 31-32:** "Evidence increasingly suggests that the overwintering stage represents the most limiting phase of the monarch's annual cycle, with population declines concentrated during winter and early spring periods"
- Citation provided (peltonWesternMonarchPopulation2019), but might benefit from additional supporting references

## Methods (chapters/vsfb/methods.tex)

### Study Site Information

**Lines 8-9:** "The base contains thirty documented monarch overwintering groves, with several sites consistently ranking within the top 10% of population counts statewide over the past decade"
- Already has citation (xercessocietyWesternMonarchButterfly2025)

### Equipment and Methodology

**Line 29:** "Near-infrared wavelength selection followed previous literature demonstrating effectiveness for butterfly population estimation"
- Already has citation (hristovEstimatingOverwinteringMonarch2019)

**Lines 33-34:** "Initial deployments used 10-minute intervals to capture significant changes in butterfly abundance, which preliminary observations indicated occurred on hourly rather than minute scales"
- Need: Citation or justification for time scale of butterfly abundance changes

**Lines 35-36:** "Information-theoretic model comparison using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) demonstrated that 30-minute intervals provided optimal balance"
- Need: Citation for AIC methodology if not standard practice

### Counting Methods

**Line 48:** "emulated field researcher methods, including those used in the annual Thanksgiving Count"
- Already has citation (xercessocietyManagingMonarchsWest2018)

## Results (chapters/vsfb/results.tex)

### Temperature Thresholds

**Line 75:** "Below the flight threshold (blue vertical band) of 12.7-16Â°C established by Masters et al. (1988)"
- Already properly cited

### Statistical Methods

The results section appears to be well-cited for statistical methods and findings, referencing appropriate literature.

## Discussion (chapters/vsfb/discussion.tex)

### Thermoregulation

**Lines 18-19:** "This finding aligns with \citeauthor{mastersMonarchButterflyDanaus1988}'s work showing that monarchs in direct sunlight can elevate their body temperature above ambient conditions within minutes."
- Already properly cited

**Lines 20-21:** "Monarchs have evolved to efficiently absorb solar radiation, an adaptation that enables flight at temperatures below what would otherwise be physiologically possible"
- Already has citation (mastersMonarchButterflyDanaus1988)

**Lines 21-22:** "Yet this same efficiency becomes a liability when clustering. Butterflies cannot avoid absorbing heat when exposed to direct sun, risking overheating and accelerated depletion of their finite lipid reserves through elevated metabolism"
- Already has citation (mastersMonarchButterflyDanaus1988)

### Geographic Variation

**Line 25:** "Given that available temperatures vary latitudinally across overwintering sites"
- Already has citation (sanieeHierarchyScaleInfluence2022)

### Diurnal Patterns

**Lines 29-30:** "This pattern persists even after controlling for temperature and sunlight, aligning with anecdotal observations from overwintering sites throughout California."
- Need: Citation for anecdotal observations of diurnal patterns at California sites

### Population Status

**Lines 33-34:** "The following season (2024--2025), virtually no clustering monarchs were observed at Vandenberg Space Force Base (23 individuals total) despite monitoring 10 sites. This coincided with the second-lowest overwintering population on record statewide"
- Already has citation (xercessocietyWesternMonarchButterfly2025)

### Large Aggregation Dynamics

**Lines 35-37:** "In historically massive aggregations containing hundreds of thousands of individuals, many butterflies attach only to other butterflies, creating multi-layered formations."
- Need: Citation describing the structure of large historical aggregations

**Lines 37-38:** "If substrate attachment confers greater wind resistance than butterfly-to-butterfly attachment, the disruptive wind hypothesis might apply specifically to these larger aggregations."
- Need: Citation or evidence for differential attachment strength

### Management Implications

**Lines 39-40:** "Areas previously dismissed due to perceived wind exposure may provide suitable conditions because they offer appropriate light and thermal regimes."
- Need: Examples or citations of areas dismissed due to wind exposure

**Lines 41-42:** "While past management efforts aimed at wind protection may have been based on incomplete understanding, they likely produced beneficial outcomes by increasing tree density."
- Need: Citation supporting benefits of increased tree density for monarchs

**Line 43:** "The fundamental recommendation to plant and maintain trees remains sound."
- Need: Citation supporting tree planting recommendations

**Lines 43-44:** "Management should prioritize maintaining existing mature trees while establishing future roosting habitat at densities that support healthy, long-lived growth."
- Need: Citation for optimal tree density recommendations

### Future Research

**Line 46:** "First, explicit testing of light patterns as predictors of clustering locations could establish whether canopy structure guides habitat selection."
- Statement of future research direction, no citation needed

**Lines 46-47:** "The strong effect of direct sunlight (F = 19.36, p < 0.001) combined with the predictability of canopy-created light patterns suggests this may be a primary factor in roost site selection."
- References own results, no additional citation needed

**Lines 53-54:** "Second, investigation of social dynamics and positive behavioral feedback mechanisms could address unexplained variation in our models."
- Need: Citation for social dynamics in monarch clustering behavior

**Lines 54-55:** "Monarchs may exhibit emergent clustering behaviors where initial settlement increases the probability of others joining, creating self-reinforcing patterns independent of environmental conditions."
- Need: Citation for aggregation behavior and positive feedback in insects or monarchs specifically
