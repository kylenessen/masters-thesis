As a charismatic and threatened species, understanding the factors that
limit monarch populations is critical for effective conservation.
Western monarch populations have declined by more than 95% from their
historic highs, prompting the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to propose
listing the monarch as a threatened species with designated critical

For decades, management of these crucial sites has been guided by the
"microclimate hypothesis," which suggests that monarchs select groves
providing a specific suite of abiotic conditions: mild temperatures,
high humidity, dappled sunlight for thermoregulation, and critically,
shelter from wind (Kingston L. H. Leong 1990). [This statement is a bit
misleading. The micro climate hypothesis has indeed been proposed. The
misleading part is that it doesn\'t really stand anymore. Kiana\'s work
indicates that there isn\'t a single microclimate. Instead, the
available, and occupied micro climate varies with latitude. Ashley\'s
work indicates that the response to temperature is more complex than
previously thought. Low and freezing temperatures are avoided during the
overwintering season, but the warmest of the cold temperatures are found
at overwintering sites.\
One way to think about it, and a possible way to present it, is that the
micro climate hypothesis has gradually been rejected. One entire aspect
of the hypothesis has not even been tested, and that is the disruptive
wind hypothesis. If you do present it this way, then, in the discussion,
you will dismantle the micro climate hypothesis. This will set you up to
propose a more physiological or energetic hypothesis instead. Honestly,
that approach seems quite powerful.\
This paragraph, more than any other, needs to be rewritten. It is
probably two paragraphs one about the micro climate hypothesis, and the
other about the disruptive wind hypothesis.]{.comment-start

predict that an information-theoretic approach will identify wind as a
significant predictor of abundance changes, with monarch abundance
decreasing when exposed to higher wind speeds.

threshold of 2 m/s. If this threshold represents a meaningful biological
boundary, we predict that monarch abundance will decline at roosts
experiencing winds exceeding 2 m/s.

Third, we hypothesized that wind's disruptive effects scale with
intensity. If disruption increases with wind speed, we predict
proportionally greater decreases in monarch abundance as wind speeds
rise above the threshold[This is a really solid ending to the

## Materials and Methods

### Study Site

Site selection followed a systematic filtering process driven by project
requirements and practical constraints. The study was supported by a
federal grant that mandated research be conducted on federal lands. We
selected Vandenberg Space Force Base (VSFB, 34.7398°N, 120.5725°W) in
Santa Barbara County, California, based on several key advantages: mild
winters with infrequent frost events, extensive historical plantings of
blue gum eucalyptus (*Eucalyptus globulus*) that have created suitable
overwintering habitat throughout the installation, and restricted access
that provided security for long-term equipment deployment. The base
contains thirty documented monarch overwintering groves, with several
sites consistently ranking within the top 10% of population counts
statewide over the past decade (Xerces Society 2025a).

Working with the base's monarch conservation coordinator, we initially
screened twelve locations from the thirty sites based on their
documented capacity to support monarch aggregations and provide
year-round access. This collaboration leveraged local expertise from
managing Western Monarch Thanksgiving Count activities for multiple
years (Xerces Society 2025a). During the study period, ten of these
sites were actively monitored. However, due to low monarch populations
during the 2023-2024 season and no observed overwintering behavior in
the 2024-2025 season, only two sites (Spring Canyon and UDMH) produced
measurable butterfly clusters suitable for our analysis.

Spring Canyon (34.6315°N, 120.6182°W) represents the most productive and
historically reliable overwintering site on VSFB. Located in South Base
within 300 meters of Space Launch Complex 4, this approximately
2.0-hectare site consists entirely of mature blue gum eucalyptus trees
reaching heights of approximately 40 meters. An unnamed perennial creek
runs through the center of the grove, creating a riparian corridor that
supports heterogeneous canopy structure with variable tree spacing and
diverse understory vegetation. Surf Road, an infrequently used paved
access road, bisects both the perennial creek and forest canopy.

The UDMH site (34.6719°N, 120.5950°W), also located in South Base,
comprises a 5.1-hectare eucalyptus grove planted in windrows adjacent to
a waste treatment facility. The uniformly spaced trees maintain a
largely clear understory with scattered low shrubs. Although only
recently documented as an overwintering location in 2022, UDMH
immediately emerged as a significant site, supporting over 6,000
monarchs during its initial count and ranking among the base's highest
population sites.

### Monitoring Strategy

Equipment deployment strategies differed between monitoring seasons to
accommodate research objectives and field experience. During the
2023-2024 season, we employed two strategies: targeted deployments at
sites with confirmed monarch presence, and anticipatory deployments at
locations where monarchs were expected based on historical data but not
currently observed. Targeted deployments concentrated at Spring Canyon
and UDMH where active aggregations were documented throughout the
season. Anticipatory deployments occurred at four overwintering sites:
additional locations within Spring Canyon and UDMH, plus SLC-6 and
Tangair. No monarchs were recorded at anticipatory deployment sites;
consequently, these data are excluded from analysis.

Building on insights from the initial season, for the 2024-2025 season
we modified our approach to establish monitoring stations at ten sites
before monarch arrival, based on historical occurrence records compiled
by the base conservation coordinator. This expanded spatial coverage
aimed to capture greater environmental variation across potential
overwintering sites. However, the 2024-2025 season coincided with
historically low monarch abundance throughout California (Xerces Society
2025b), resulting in no observed clustering behavior at any monitored
location on base. Consequently, our final dataset comprises two sites
(Spring Canyon and UDMH) from the 2023-2024 season only.

### Field Equipment

To observe changes in monarch abundance in response to strong wind
events, we deployed remote monitoring equipment near butterfly clusters
at overwintering sites. Field observations utilized 15-meter telescoping
fiberglass poles (Max-Gain Systems, Inc., Marietta, GA) anchored at
three points using ground anchors with guy lines securing both the top
and base to create stable, freestanding structures.

Poles were positioned 4-17 meters from cluster locations. This range,
determined through field testing, balanced image resolution requirements
for our grid-based counting method against disturbance minimization.
Closer positioning compromised field of view, while greater distances
degraded butterfly visibility below classification thresholds. Pole
placement considered ground stability for the 15-meter structures,
infrastructure clearance requirements, and clear viewing angles. When
deploying near active clusters, we approached from directions that
minimized disturbance; no butterfly dispersal was observed during
equipment deployment.

We monitored monarch abundance using modified trail cameras (GardePro E7
and E8, Shenzhen, China) configured for near-infrared imaging to enhance
contrast between clustering butterflies and surrounding vegetation.
Trail cameras were selected for their durability in extended field
deployment, native time-lapse functionality, and modification potential.
Near-infrared wavelength selection followed previous literature
demonstrating effectiveness for butterfly population estimation (Hristov
et al. 2019).

Hardware modifications exploited the camera's internal filter-switching
mechanism by engaging nighttime mode to access the clear glass filter
position, then disconnecting power to prevent reversion to the infrared
cut filter. Near-infrared pass filters (\>850 nm) were mounted
externally to restrict incoming light to NIR wavelengths. This
configuration produced images where clustering butterflies appeared as
dark masses against bright eucalyptus foliage reflectance in the
near-infrared spectrum. Field validation confirmed sufficient contrast
for visual distinction of monarch clusters from background vegetation,
supporting our human-labeler analytical approach.

Cameras were mounted atop poles using lightweight tie-down straps and
positioned horizontally toward butterfly clusters at roosting height.
The wireless live view feature enabled real-time preview and precise
camera aiming during deployment. Cameras operated in time-lapse mode
with motion detection disabled.

Sampling interval selection balanced temporal resolution, battery life,
and data processing feasibility through empirical optimization and
rigorous statistical validation. Initial deployments used 10-minute
intervals to capture significant changes in butterfly abundance, which
preliminary observations indicated occurred on hourly rather than minute
scales, while maintaining approximately 6-week continuous operation.
Post-deployment statistical analysis using mixed-effects models and
information-theoretic approaches systematically compared multiple
sampling intervals across deployments. We conducted sequential subsample
analyses starting with full temporal resolution and progressively
testing reduced frequencies. Information-theoretic model comparison
using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) demonstrated that 30-minute
intervals provided optimal balance, losing less than 5% of information
compared to full temporal resolution (measured by root mean square
error) while reducing image classification workload by 67%. Variance
comparison analysis and visual assessment of fitted trend lines
confirmed that this interval preserved essential time-series patterns
including diurnal activity cycles, weather-response dynamics, and
multi-day population trends. Battery life constraints and field
deployment logistics further supported this interval choice, enabling
extended autonomous operation essential for capturing complete
behavioral sequences during variable weather conditions.

To quantify the wind conditions hypothesized to influence butterfly
behavior, wind monitoring equipment consisted of Rain Wise WindLog Wind
Data Loggers (Rain Wise Inc., Trenton, Maine) installed at pole apices
to measure wind at heights approximating butterfly roosting locations.
These instruments recorded average wind speed and maximum wind gust at
one-minute intervals, the highest frequency supported by the sensors.
This recording interval enabled calculation of wind speed variance
within each photographic sampling period, capturing gustiness lost with
longer averaging periods.

To systematically organize our heterogeneous monitoring efforts, we
defined discrete monitoring periods as deployment units. Each deployment
represented a unique combination of monitoring location, camera
configuration (including camera ID, mounting height, and viewing angle),
associated wind measurements, and temporal coverage period. Since
equipment was frequently reused across locations and time periods, this
deployment-based structure provided standardized sampling units that
accounted for variation in environmental conditions and equipment
configurations while treating each deployment as independent for
statistical analyses. This approach produced time-series images from
each deployment for estimating monarch cluster abundance through
systematic grid-based counting methods, enabling analysis of abundance
patterns in relation to wind speed and other environmental variables.

### Image Analysis

#### Grid-based Counting Method

To quantify changes in monarch butterfly abundance from collected
imagery, we developed a systematic grid-based counting protocol
balancing accuracy with the practical constraints of analyzing tens of
thousands of images. This approach addressed the challenge of estimating
abundance in large aggregations where individual counts would be
prohibitively time-consuming and emulated field researcher methods,
including those used in the annual Thanksgiving Count (Xerces Society
2017). We subdivided each image using a grid overlay system where human
labelers assigned order-of-magnitude estimates per cell. Grid dimensions
remained fixed throughout each deployment to ensure consistency. Custom
software developed using the Electron framework in JavaScript
facilitated this labeling effort.

Grid cell size varied by deployment based on camera-to-cluster distance.
Cell dimensions were optimized to ensure most occupied cells contained
butterflies in the 10--99 count range, balancing classification
efficiency with spatial resolution. This standardization minimized cells
alternating between widely different order-of-magnitude categories
across the time series.

#### Counting Protocol

Human labelers estimated butterfly abundance within each grid cell using
four order-of-magnitude categories: 0 (no butterflies), 1--9 (single
digits), 10--99 (dozens), and 100--999 (hundreds). Labelers trained
using a comprehensive online guide with example images and detailed
classification criteria
(<https://kylenessen.github.io/monarch_trailcam_classifier/>). The
protocol prioritized efficiency while maintaining consistency across
observers.

Because abundance estimates derived exclusively from two-dimensional
photographic images, our classification protocol quantified only
butterflies visible in the image plane without estimating
three-dimensional cluster structure or depth. This approach
intentionally excluded hidden individuals behind visible butterflies in
overlapping aggregations, providing a conservative but consistent
measure reflecting observable surface area rather than total volume. For
cells containing partial butterflies at grid boundaries, labelers
included these in counts unless double-counting would cause an adjacent
cell to move to a higher category. When butterfly counts fluctuated
between categories across the time series, we consistently applied the
lower estimate to maintain conservative abundance estimates.

In addition to estimating monarch abundance, labelers recorded whether
cells received direct sunlight. Direct sunlight classification presented
challenges because oversaturated conditions eliminated the contrast
enabling butterfly detection in shaded areas. Labelers classified cells
as receiving direct sunlight when branches or butterflies exhibited
additional illumination clearly from direct rather than indirect light,
even when individual butterflies became difficult to distinguish due to
pixel oversaturation. This classification required careful attention to
subtle shape recognition and contextual awareness about butterfly
locations established from previous images in the time series. This
measurement was recorded only for occupied cells and stored separately.

Labelers received ongoing feedback throughout the classification
process. All classifications underwent review for common errors
including mislabeled cells, incorrect category assignments, and
inconsistent counting criteria application. Direct communication of
corrections to labelers ensured consistent protocol application.

#### Abundance Calculation

We calculated an abundance index for each frame by summing the products
of cell counts and their assigned category values across all grid cells,
employing conservative estimates using minimum values within each
order-of-magnitude category:

$$\text{Abundance index} = \sum_{i}^{}\rho_{i} \times C_{i}$$

where $\rho_{i}$ represents the number of cells in category $i$, and
$C_{i}$ represents the conservative estimate for that category. We used
minimum category values ($C_{1} = 1$ for category 1--9, $C_{2} = 10$ for
category 10--99, and $C_{3} = 100$ for category 100--999) rather than
midpoint or maximum values to ensure temporal analyses reflected genuine
population shifts rather than estimation uncertainty.

### Temperature Data Extraction

Temperature represents a critical environmental variable influencing
monarch activity patterns and potentially confounding wind effects.
Ambient temperature data were extracted from trail camera images using
optical character recognition (OCR). Each camera displayed temperature
readings on the image overlay, but these values were not accessible
through EXIF metadata, necessitating visual extraction methods. We
developed an automated Python script utilizing OCR technology to extract
temperature values from approximately 56,000 images across all
deployments. The extraction process employed multiple preprocessing
strategies and pattern matching algorithms to accommodate variations in
image quality and display characteristics.

Following initial automated extraction, we manually reviewed and
corrected edge cases where OCR failed or produced anomalous values. All
temperature data underwent systematic quality control through
visualization of deployment-specific time series, enabling
identification and correction of erroneous values. This process ensured
complete temperature coverage for all analyzed images, providing the
ambient temperature covariate required for our statistical models.

### Statistical Analysis

#### Data Preparation

Statistical analysis employed a lag-based framework to capture the
temporal dynamics of butterfly responses to environmental changes,
comparing butterfly counts between consecutive 30-minute intervals.
Observation pairs were constructed by matching counts at time $t$ with
counts at time $t - 30$ minutes, applying a ±5 minute tolerance window
to accommodate minor temporal variations in image capture. The response
variable (change in butterfly abundance between time points) underwent
cube root transformation to achieve approximate normality while
preserving directional information:
$y = \text{sign}(\Delta) \times |\Delta|^{1/3}$, where $\Delta$
represents the difference in butterfly counts. While exploratory data
analysis revealed generally well-behaved distributions, we observed
bimodality in the raw butterfly abundance data driven primarily by a
single anomalous event at deployment SC8. At this deployment, a large
butterfly aggregation abruptly declined to near zero without
corresponding changes in the measured environmental variables (wind
speed, temperature, or solar exposure). This singular event was unlike
any other observation in the dataset. We retained this deployment in the
final analysis for two reasons: first, to maximize sample size and avoid
arbitrary data exclusion, and second, sensitivity analysis showed that
the cube root transformation of abundance differences adequately
addressed the distributional concerns, with model selection and
parameter estimates remaining consistent whether SC8 was included or
excluded. The transformation approach made the anomaly's inclusion or
exclusion immaterial to the final results. Observation pairs where both
time points recorded zero butterflies were excluded as uninformative,
reducing the dataset from approximately 2,500 potential pairs to 1,894
analyzable observations across 115 unique deployment-day combinations.

#### Variable Selection

Predictor variables were selected to test specific hypotheses while
avoiding multicollinearity. Maximum wind gust speed during each
30-minute interval served as the primary wind metric, with alternative
wind measurements (average sustained speed, modal gust, gust standard
deviation) excluded due to high correlation ($r > 0.75$). Environmental
predictors included average temperature between observation pairs,
number of butterflies in direct sunlight at the previous time point, and
minutes elapsed since the first observation of each day to capture
diurnal patterns. Total butterfly count at the previous time point was
included as a control variable, enabling distinction between
proportional and absolute changes in abundance. When included, this
variable tests effects on proportional change; when excluded, models
test effects on absolute change.

#### Model Framework

Analysis employed generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs) implemented
through the mgcv package in R. Model selection followed an
information-theoretic approach, comparing 48 candidate models using
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The candidate set comprised two
fundamental frameworks: models including the lag abundance term (24
models) and models excluding it (24 models), with each framework
containing null models, single predictor models, additive combinations,
two- and three-way interactions, and models incorporating smooth terms
for non-linear relationships. Random effects structure accounted for
variation at three hierarchical levels: deployment location, observer,
and deployment-day. Temporal autocorrelation within days was addressed
using a first-order autoregressive (AR1) correlation structure grouped
by deployment-day. All models were fitted using restricted maximum
likelihood (REML) estimation.

To test specifically for threshold effects at the proposed 2 m/s
disruptive wind speed, we conducted a sensitivity analysis using an
alternative wind metric. We repeated the entire model selection process,
replacing maximum wind gust speed with a threshold-based predictor: the
count of minutes within each 30-minute observation period where wind
gusts equaled or exceeded 2 m/s. This variable ranged from 0 to 30
minutes and was tested using the same 48 model structures, allowing
direct comparison of continuous versus threshold-based wind effects.

#### Model Validation

Model assumptions were verified through standard residual diagnostics
including examination of residual distributions, fitted versus residual
plots, and quantile-quantile plots. Convergence was confirmed for all
candidate models in both the primary and sensitivity analyses. Model
performance and predictor significance were evaluated through AIC

#### Statistical Power Analysis

To evaluate whether our study had adequate statistical power to detect
wind effects if present, we conducted a simulation-based power analysis.
This approach assessed our ability to detect various effect sizes given
our sample size of 1,894 paired observations. We simulated 200 datasets
from the best-fitting model (which excluded wind effects) and
artificially introduced wind effects of known magnitude ranging from
0.05 to 0.20 standard deviations of the response variable. For each
effect size, we refitted models including wind terms to determine the
proportion of simulations where the artificial effect was detected as
statistically significant ($\alpha = 0.05$). This simulation approach
accounts for the complexity of our GAMM framework and hierarchical data
structure, providing robust estimates of statistical power for detecting
wind effects across a range of biologically plausible magnitudes.

## Results

### Descriptive [This is a really nice addition. Thank you.]{.comment-start id="1575825837" author="Francis X. Villablanca" date="2025-09-19T07:42:25"}Statistics[]{.comment-end id="1575825837"}

Environmental conditions varied substantially across the 78-day
monitoring period at Spring Canyon and UDMH during the 2023-2024
overwintering season. The dataset comprised 1,894 observations collected
at 30-minute intervals during daylight hours (07:00--17:00) from
November 17, 2023, to February 4, 2024, totaling 947 observation hours
across 115 unique deployment-day combinations.

Wind speeds ranged from complete calm to moderately strong conditions,
with maximum gusts reaching 12.4 m/s (mean = 2.2 ± 1.4 m/s, median = 2.2
m/s). The interquartile range of 1.3--3.0 m/s indicated that most
observations occurred under relatively mild wind conditions. Temperature
showed considerable variation throughout the monitoring period, ranging
from 3.0 to 30.0°C (mean = 14.6 ± 3.8°C, median = 14.0°C), with an
interquartile range of 12.5--17.0°C typical of California coastal winter
conditions. Direct solar exposure occurred in 31.7% of observations (n =
601), with butterflies actively basking when present in sunlight,
averaging 17.0 individuals in direct sun (range: 1--295).

Monarch abundance exhibited high variability across sites and time
periods. Butterfly counts ranged from 0 to 770 individuals per
observation, with a mean of 81.4 ± 100.0 butterflies and a median of 37
butterflies. The wide interquartile range (9--119 butterflies) reflected
substantial variation in cluster sizes. [When you stay, the 5.3% of
variance explained, you might refer back to this fact as a possible
reason. This is a fairly small proportion of the entire data

Cluster sizes varied markedly among the 10 deployment locations. Site
SC10 recorded the largest aggregation with 770 monarchs, while mean
abundances ranged from 0 at SC9 to 325.8 at UDMH2. Eight deployments
observed maximum cluster sizes exceeding 100 butterflies, with mean
maximum cluster size across sites reaching 315.6 individuals. This
variation in cluster sizes across deployments reflects the heterogeneous

The comprehensive temporal coverage, with observations at 30-minute
intervals capturing 16.5 observations per deployment-day on average,
provided fine-scale resolution of monarch behavioral responses to
changing environmental conditions. Peak observation activity occurred at
16:00 hours (196 observations), corresponding with afternoon warming
periods when monarchs typically exhibit increased movement.

### Analysis of the Best-Fit Model

The best-fit model (M23) explained 5.7% of variance in monarch abundance
changes (adjusted R² = 0.057). The model formula was:

$$\text{Change in abundance} \sim s(\text{Previous butterfly count}) + s(\text{Temperature}) + s(\text{Butterflies in direct sun}) + s(\text{Time since sunrise})$$

where $s()$ denotes smooth terms. All four smooth terms showed
significant effects on monarch abundance changes.

  : Summary of smooth terms in the best-fit model (M23). EDF represents
  effective degrees of freedom, indicating the complexity of each smooth
  relationship.

All four predictors in the best-fit model showed significant effects on
monarch abundance changes (Figure [1.1](#fig:partial_effects)). The
previous butterfly count exhibited a significant non-linear negative
relationship (EDF = 2.62, F = 12.02, p \< 0.001), with increasingly
negative changes as the previous count increased, indicating
proportionally greater departures from larger aggregations. Butterflies
in direct sun showed a strong negative effect on roost abundance (EDF =
1.53, F = 19.36, p \< 0.001), with greater numbers in direct sun
associated with larger decreases in total abundance.

Time since sunrise revealed a pronounced diurnal pattern (EDF = 4.90, F
= 8.90, p \< 0.001), with monarchs departing clusters throughout the
morning and reaching peak departures approximately 3.25 hours after
sunrise. Cluster reformation began in the afternoon, with most
butterflies returning around 8.25 hours after sunrise, capturing the
characteristic daily rhythm of monarch activity at overwintering sites.
Temperature exhibited a complex non-linear relationship (EDF = 3.93, F =
3.23, p = 0.028). Below the flight threshold (blue vertical band) of
12.7-16°C established by Masters et al. (1988), temperature had minimal
effect on cluster abundance. Above this threshold, clusters reformed as
temperatures increased up to 25°C, with peak reformation occurring
around 21°C. Beyond 25°C, the pattern reversed, with each additional
degree Celsius increasing departure rates from clusters.

### Evaluation of the Disruptive Wind Hypothesis

Our analysis provided no support for the three hierarchical wind
hypotheses:

First, wind did not act as a disruptive force to overwintering monarchs.
Among our 48 candidate models, wind appeared in only one of the top five
models (M24), where it showed little evidence of an effect (p = 0.218)
and resulted in substantially poorer model performance compared to the
best model (ΔAIC = 6.2). The partial effect of maximum wind speed from
this model remains flat with wide uncertainty across the observed range,
reinforcing the lack of a coherent signal
(Figure [1.2](#fig:m24_wind_partial_effect)).

[]{#fig:m24_wind_partial_effect
.anchor}![](media/image2.png){width="3.7916666666666665in"
height="3.1597222222222223in"}

Partial effect of maximum wind speed on monarch abundance change from
model M24. The flat relationship with wide confidence intervals
demonstrates no clear effect of wind on butterfly departures. The red
dashed line indicates the proposed 2 m/s disruptive threshold.

Second, we found no evidence for disruption above the proposed 2 m/s
threshold. A sensitivity analysis using a specific threshold predictor
('minutes with wind speed \> 2 m/s') confirmed this lack of a threshold
effect, as models with this variable performed poorly and did not rank
among the top candidates (Table [1.3](#tab:threshold_model_selection)).
Visually, the relationship between wind and monarch abundance change
remained flat across the 2 m/s boundary
(Figure [1.3](#fig:wind_scatter)). With mean maximum wind speeds of
2.2 m/s (SD = 1.4 m/s), conditions that should have revealed threshold
effects if present, no disruption occurred at or above this boundary.

### Statistical Power to Detect Wind Effects

Post-hoc power analysis confirmed our study had adequate statistical
power to detect biologically meaningful wind effects
(Table [1.4](#tab:power_analysis)). With 1,894 paired observations, we
achieved 87.5% power to detect moderate effect sizes (0.15 standard
deviations) and 98.5% power to detect larger effects (0.20 standard
deviations). Power for small effects (0.10 standard deviations) was 56%,
while very small effects (0.05 standard deviations) yielded only 16.5%
power. These results indicate that our failure to detect wind effects is
unlikely due to insufficient statistical power for effect sizes of
biological relevance.

## Discussion

### Wind Does Not Disrupt Overwintering Monarch Butterflies

Our study provides the first direct empirical test of the disruptive
wind hypothesis and finds no support for wind as a primary factor
influencing monarch butterfly clustering behavior. Despite the
widespread adoption of the 2 m/s wind threshold in conservation practice
(Society 2016), our data reveal no relationship between wind speed and
butterfly departures across the full range of observed conditions (0--12
m/s). While our models explain only 5.7% of variance in butterfly
movements, reflecting our focus on testing wind effects rather than
comprehensively explaining movement patterns, they had sufficient
statistical power to detect environmental signals. This finding
challenges assumptions underlying three decades of management guidance.

The absence of wind effects in our data is particularly striking given
that observed mean maximum wind speeds (2.2 m/s, SD = 1.4) frequently
exceeded the proposed threshold. If the disruptive wind hypothesis were
valid, we should have observed a clear signal: substantial reductions in
butterfly abundance, as predicted by the disruptive wind hypothesis.
Instead, we observed no change, small changes, or even positive changes
in butterfly abundance at wind speeds six times the proposed disruption
threshold.

Importantly, our power analysis demonstrated 87.5% power to detect
moderate effect sizes (0.15 standard deviations) and 98.5% power for
larger effects (0.20 standard deviations), while wind appeared in only
one of the top five models (M24). In that model wind showed little
evidence of an effect (p = 0.218) and resulted in substantially poorer
model performance compared to the best model (ΔAIC = 6.2, capturing only
4% of model weight). This weak wind signal, combined with our high
statistical power, allows us to rule out all but very small wind
effects. Given that the disruptive wind hypothesis predicts conspicious
reduction in abundance above threshold wind speeds, a substantial effect
by any measure, our failure to detect such patterns provides strong
evidence against the hypothesis rather than merely absence of evidence.

The methodological validity of our approach is confirmed by the strong
signals detected for other environmental variables. Had our counting
method or analytical framework been flawed, we would not have captured
the pronounced effects of direct sunlight (F = 19.36, p \< 0.001) or the
complex diurnal patterns (F = 8.90, p \< 0.001) that emerged from the
same dataset.

### Alternative Drivers of Monarch Movement

While our study was designed specifically to test the wind hypothesis,
our results suggest that thermoregulation, light exposure, and diurnal
rhythms play more important roles than wind in driving short-term
movements at overwintering sites.

#### Direct Sunlight as the Strongest Predictor

Direct sunlight exposure emerged as the strongest environmental
predictor of reductions in cluster abundance in our study (F = 19.36, p
\< 0.001). Butterflies exposed to direct sunlight at the beginning of an
observation interval showed the largest decreases in abundance,
suggesting that solar radiation rapidly increases butterfly body
temperatures well above ambient conditions. This finding aligns with
Masters, Malcolm, and Brower (1988)'s work showing that monarchs in
direct sunlight can elevate their body temperature above ambient
conditions within minutes. This rapid warming capability could readily
explain why direct sunlight exposure is such a strong predictor of
decreased abundance at clusters.

The relationship between sunlight and departure represents a key
component of the thermoregulatory equation. Monarchs have evolved to
efficiently absorb solar radiation, an adaptation that enables flight at
temperatures below what would otherwise be physiologically possible
(Masters, Malcolm, and Brower 1988). Yet this same efficiency becomes a
liability when clustering. Butterflies cannot avoid absorbing heat when
exposed to direct sun, risking overheating and accelerated depletion of
their finite lipid reserves through elevated metabolism (Masters,
Malcolm, and Brower 1988). This forces them to abandon energetically
favorable clustering positions even when ambient temperatures remain
cool. This trade-off between the benefits of clustering and the thermal
constraints imposed by solar exposure may fundamentally shape daily
movement patterns at overwintering sites.

#### Temperature Effects and Their Interpretation

Ambient temperature showed a subtle but significant relationship with
monarch abundance changes (EDF = 3.93, F = 3.23, p = 0.028). The data
suggest minimal change below 15°C (the known flight threshold), a slight
positive association around 20--21°C, and sharp declines above 25°C
consistent with thermoregulatory constraints. Given that available
temperatures vary latitudinally across overwintering sites (Saniee and
Villablanca 2022), our results from Spring Canyon capture only a portion
of the temperature continuum experienced across the entire overwintering
range. The temperature effects we observed reflect responses within the
specific thermal envelope available at our study latitude. Testing these
patterns at sites spanning the full latitudinal gradient would reveal
whether monarch responses to temperature are consistent or vary with
local thermal regimes.

#### Diurnal Activity Patterns

Time since sunrise revealed distinct diurnal patterns (EDF = 4.90, F =
8.90, p \< 0.001), with butterflies departing clusters in the morning
and reforming aggregations in the afternoon. This pattern persists even
after controlling for temperature and sunlight, aligning with anecdotal
observations from overwintering sites throughout California.

### Study Limitations

Several limitations warrant consideration. Our data derive from a single
season (2023--2024) with typical monarch abundance at two sites. The
following season (2024--2025), virtually no clustering monarchs were
observed at Vandenberg Space Force Base (23 individuals total) despite
monitoring 10 sites. This coincided with the second-lowest overwintering
population on record statewide (Xerces Society 2025b), preventing
temporal replication of our study. Additionally, our counting
methodology introduced discretization artifacts that contributed to
large confidence intervals for environmental predictors. While we
detected strong signals like direct sunlight effects, more subtle
relationships require careful interpretation.

Furthermore, our study observed clusters where butterflies maintained
direct substrate contact. In historically massive aggregations
containing hundreds of thousands of individuals, many butterflies attach
only to other butterflies, creating multi-layered formations. If
substrate attachment confers greater wind resistance than
butterfly-to-butterfly attachment, the disruptive wind hypothesis might
apply specifically to these larger aggregations. Future work should
examine whether wind responses differ between substrate-attached and
butterfly-attached individuals, particularly at sites supporting extreme
densities.

### Management Implications

Our findings suggest that management strategies prioritizing wind
protection warrant reconsideration. The absence of wind effects despite
frequent threshold exceedances indicates that usable habitat within
existing groves may be larger than currently recognized. Areas
previously dismissed due to perceived wind exposure may provide suitable
conditions because they offer appropriate light and thermal regimes.

While past management efforts aimed at wind protection may have been
based on incomplete understanding, they likely produced beneficial
outcomes by increasing tree density. The fundamental recommendation to
plant and maintain trees remains sound. Management should prioritize
maintaining existing mature trees while establishing future roosting
habitat at densities that support healthy, long-lived growth. In
addition, as suggested by Saniee and Villablanca (2022), it may become
relevant to explore ways in which to manage for thermal attributes,
specifically sunlight.

### Future Research Directions

Our findings open several important avenues for future research. First,
explicit testing of light patterns as predictors of clustering locations
could establish whether canopy structure guides habitat selection. The
strong effect of direct sunlight (F = 19.36, p \< 0.001) combined with
the predictability of canopy-created light patterns suggests this may be
a primary factor in roost site selection. Previous research also
suggests light conditions may play an important role in habitat
selection. [(]{.deletion author="Francis X. Villablanca"

both a specific range of canopy openness ( 20%) and lower variance
compared to transient and unoccupied/former sites.

Monarchs may exhibit emergent clustering behaviors where initial
settlement increases the probability of others joining, creating
self-reinforcing patterns independent of environmental conditions.

Research should also examine whether our findings extend across the
broader overwintering range. Testing these patterns at sites with
different tree species, latitudes, and in particular population
densities would strengthen conclusions about the generality of wind
effects, or their absence.

### Conclusions

Wind did not disrupt monarch clusters even at speeds far exceeding
presumptive thresholds. Instead, butterflies responded primarily to
thermal conditions, including light exposure and ambient temperature,
and to diurnal rhythms. These findings challenge current assumptions
about overwintering habitat requirements and suggest that management
priorities should be reevaluated. While our study represents one season
at two sites, the absence of wind effects despite adequate statistical
power raises important questions regarding decades of conservation
guidelines. As monarch populations face continued threats,
evidence-based management becomes increasingly critical for conserving
the overwintering sites essential for this iconic species.
