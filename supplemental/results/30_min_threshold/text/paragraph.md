Environmental factors, but not wind, drove monarch abundance changes in 1894 paired observations from 115 monitoring periods at 2 overwintering sites during the 2023-2024 season. Testing of 52 candidate models identified T50 as the best-fit model. Model T50 included smooth terms for Previous butterfly count, Temperature, Time since sunrise, wind x sun interaction, achieving an AIC value of 8077.232. T50 captured 0.554 of the model weight across 52 candidates (AIC = 8077.2), with the next best model Delta AIC = 0.6. Wind variables appeared in 2 of the top five models (including T50). The strongest alternative wind model, T24, trailed T50 (Delta AIC = 8.2) with wind p = 0.372.
