Environmental factors, but not wind, drove monarch abundance changes in 1894 paired observations from 115 monitoring periods at 2 overwintering sites during the 2023-2024 season. Testing of 52 candidate models identified M50 as the best-fit model. Model M50 included smooth terms for Previous butterfly count, Temperature, Time since sunrise, wind x sun interaction, achieving an AIC value of 8074.029. M50 captured 0.858 of the model weight across 52 candidates (AIC = 8074), with the next best model Delta AIC = 3.8. Wind variables appeared in 3 of the top five models (including M50). The strongest alternative wind model, M24, trailed M50 (Delta AIC = 10) with wind p = 0.218.
