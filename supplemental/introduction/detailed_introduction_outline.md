# Detailed Introduction Outline

## Paragraph 1: Biotic and Abiotic Factors

- **Opening:** The distribution and survival of invertebrate species are governed by a complex interplay of biotic and abiotic factors
- **Biotic factors examples:** Competition for resources, predation pressure, parasitism, mutualistic relationships (with citations)
- **Transition to abiotic:** While biotic interactions shape community dynamics, abiotic conditions often set the fundamental limits on where invertebrates can persist
- **Abiotic examples WITH MONARCH CONNECTIONS:**
  - Temperature thresholds governing development rates and survival across all life stages
  - Humidity requirements (or vapor pressure deficit) preventing desiccation
  - Light cycles governing diurnal/seasonal behaviors and photoperiod-induced diapause
  - Precipitation patterns affecting milkweed availability and nectar resources
- **Other organisms as moderators:** Many invertebrates exploit habitats where vegetation moderates extreme conditions, buffering temperature fluctuations and providing shelter
- **Energetic constraint focus:** For species with fixed energy budgets during critical life stages, maintaining low metabolic rates through appropriate habitat selection becomes essential for survival

## Paragraph 2: Wind as Critical Abiotic Factor

- **Wind's diverse impacts on invertebrates:**
  - Dispersal and migration: Spider ballooning exploiting wind for colonization (Bonte & Lens 2007; Nathan et al. 2005)
  - Foraging efficiency: Namibian beetles emerging when wind releases detritus from sand (Hanrahan & Kirchner 1997)
  - Predation risk and protection: Larvae seeking leeward shelter on leaves (Leonard et al. 2016)
  - Communication interference: Katydids timing calls to avoid wind-induced vibratory noise (Velilla et al. 2020)
  - Behavioral thresholds: Cockroach orientation shifts at specific wind speeds (Bell & Kramer 1979)
- **Wind's multidimensional nature:**
  - Not just average speed but consistency/variability matters
  - Gustiness and turbulence create different challenges than steady winds
  - Direction and predictability affect behavioral responses
  - Species-specific thresholds trigger distinct behavioral changes
- **Economic/energetic reality:** For many invertebrates, wind exposure increases metabolic expenditure through thermoregulation and maintaining position, threatening fixed energy budgets
- **Transition:** The monarch butterfly presents an exceptional system for studying these dynamics, as its complex life history exposes it to wind's varied influences while operating under severe energetic constraints during overwintering

## Paragraph 3: Monarch Complex Life History

- **Individual development:** Temperature-dependent development from egg through metamorphosis, with rates varying predictably with thermal conditions
- **Breeding phase:** Multiple generations exploiting milkweed across North America
  - Milkweed's cardiac glycosides confer chemical protection to all life stages
  - Temperature and photoperiod constraints on reproduction and development
- **Transition to diapause:** Environmental cues (decreasing photoperiod, cooler temperatures) triggering expression changes
  - Juvenile hormone suppression creating "super generation"
  - Larger body size, enhanced lipid storage (up to 125% of lean body weight), extended lifespan (8-9 months vs. 2-5 weeks)
- **Overwintering phase:**
  - Eastern population: Tens of millions clustering on Oyamel fir forests in Mexican mountains
  - Western population: Aggregating primarily in California coastal eucalyptus groves within 1.6 km of coast
  - **Critical energetic constraint:** Fixed lipid reserves must sustain 4-5 months without feeding
  - **Thermal thresholds:** Flight initiation requires 12.7-16.0°C (Masters et al. 1988)
  - **Metabolic suppression:** Clustering reduces individual surface area exposure, minimizing heat loss
  - **Shivering capability:** Allows reaching flight threshold but at significant energetic cost
- **Terminology standardization:** "Butterfly abundance at overwintering clusters" will be referred to as "monarch abundance" throughout

## Paragraph 4: Conservation Context

- **Population collapse:** Western monarchs declined to as low as 5% of 1980s abundance (Schultz et al. 2017)
  - Recent counts show continued instability (Xerces Society 2024, 2025)
- **Federal response:** USFWS proposed threatened listing with critical habitat designation (2024)
- **Spatial constraint:**
  - Overwintering habitat comprises <0.001% of total range (calculate: ~5,000 acres vs. North America)
  - California sites confined to narrow coastal strip, typically within 1.6 km of ocean
  - >50% of sites on state park lands - manageable conservation partnership
- **Overwintering as population bottleneck:**
  - Each female can lay 400+ eggs - exponential growth potential
  - Starting population size directly affects seasonal recruitment
  - Overwintering survival determines breeding population foundation
  - Best opportunity for population monitoring through standardized counts
- **Key threat:** Degradation and senescence of aging eucalyptus groves

## Paragraph 5: Original Microclimate Hypothesis

- **Historical development:** Leong (1990) synthesized observations into formal hypothesis
- **Original parameters with energetic rationale:**
  - Mild temperatures (~13°C/55°F): Below flight threshold to prevent activity
  - High humidity: Prevent desiccation without access to water
  - Dappled sunlight: Allow thermoregulation without triggering flight
  - Wind protection (<2 m/s): Prevent dislodgement and reduce energetic costs
- **Underlying principle:** All conditions aimed at minimizing metabolic rate to conserve finite lipid reserves through 4-5 month overwintering period
- **Management adoption:** Became foundation for federal/state guidelines and restoration planning
- **Investment scale:** Millions in conservation funding allocated based on these parameters

## Paragraph 6: Systematic Dismantling of Microclimate Hypothesis

- **Temperature component - not fixed but flexible:**
  - Saniee & Villablanca (2022): No temperature differences within groves
  - Temperature ranges vary significantly with latitude (8-18°C gradient)
  - Monarchs select thermal regime appropriate to location, not static temperature
  - Suggests adaptation to regional conditions rather than fixed requirements
- **Humidity component - not determinative:**
  - No meaningful variation detected within groves over meters scale
  - Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) showed little variation across cluster locations
  - Air masses don't vary meaningfully at microhabitat scale (meters)
- **Macroclimate supersedes microclimate:**
  - Fisher et al. (2018): Species distribution models identify regional climate as primary driver
  - Minimum December temperature best predictor at landscape scale
  - Challenges fundamental assumption of within-grove heterogeneity
- **Light - the sole component with consistent empirical support:**
  - Weiss et al. (1991): Permanent sites cluster at ~20% canopy openness (ISF)
  - Saniee & Villablanca (2022): Light differences detected at cluster sites
  - Predictable canopy patterns may guide roost selection
  - Note: This study will further support light's importance
- **Wind - the untested pillar:**
  - Never directly tested despite 30+ years of management based on threshold
  - Remains primary focus of restoration efforts and funding allocation
  - Most tractable management target (plant trees for windbreaks)

## Paragraph 7: The Disruptive Wind Hypothesis

- **Development timeline with methodological notes:**
  - 1990: Leong compares wind between occupied/unoccupied trees - correlational observation
  - 1991: Multivariate analysis reinforces pattern - still observational
  - 1999: Los Osos manipulation credits wind protection - indirect inference
  - 2004: Additional claims about wind importance - no new data
  - 2016: Management guide codifies 2 m/s as critical threshold - becomes doctrine
- **The specific hypothesis:**
  - Wind >2 m/s physically dislodges butterflies from clusters
  - Triggers energetically costly escape responses depleting lipid reserves
  - Creates unsuitable conditions regardless of other favorable factors
- **NOTE Leong's methodological limitation:**
  - Focused only on average wind speed
  - Ignored gustiness, turbulence, consistency
  - No consideration of confounding variables
- **Widespread adoption despite gaps:**
  - Federal/state agency guidelines mandate 2 m/s protection
  - Restoration plans designed around wind modeling (Ellwood Mesa, Pismo Beach)
  - Tree planting configurations based on windbreak principles
  - Millions allocated for wind protection infrastructure
- **Critical gap:** Hypothesis derived from correlation, never tested for causation

## Paragraph 8: Necessity for Direct Testing - Confounding Variables

- **Why correlational observations insufficient:**
  - Initial observations identify plausible hypotheses, not causal conclusions
  - Multiple environmental factors covary in natural settings
  - Butterfly responses may be driven by unmeasured variables
- **Specific confounding variables requiring control:**
  - **Solar radiation:** Monarchs require solar heating to reach flight threshold (12.7-16.0°C)
  - **Ambient temperature:** Independent trigger for activity/inactivity
  - **Shivering behavior:** Energetically expensive method to achieve flight temperature
  - **Time of day:** Diurnal patterns independent of environmental conditions
  - **Social factors:** Clustering dynamics may override environmental cues
- **The separation challenge:**
  - Movement from successful thermoregulation indistinguishable from wind disruption
  - Temperature, sunlight, and wind often correlate in field conditions
  - Need simultaneous measurement of all variables with butterfly observations
- **Wind's complexity ignored in previous work:**
  - Average speed vs. maximum gusts may trigger different responses
  - Consistency vs. variability affects butterfly grip and energy expenditure
  - Turbulence creates different challenges than laminar flow
- **Required approach:** Continuous monitoring capturing all variables simultaneously while directly observing butterfly responses

## Paragraph 9: Study Objectives and Hypotheses

- **Primary objective:** Provide first direct empirical test of disruptive wind hypothesis
- **Approach:**
  - Continuous time-series observations of butterfly abundance (30-minute intervals)
  - Simultaneous monitoring: wind (speed, gusts, variability), temperature, solar radiation
  - Information-theoretic framework to evaluate relative importance of predictors
  - Statistical isolation of wind effects from confounding thermal drivers

**Three hierarchical hypotheses with specific predictions:**

1. **Wind as predictor hypothesis:**
   - Statement: Wind, alongside other environmental factors (temperature, sunlight, time), predicts monarch abundance changes
   - Prediction: Information-theoretic model selection will identify wind as significant predictor
   - Expected pattern: Negative relationship between wind speed and butterfly abundance

2. **Threshold effect hypothesis:**
   - Statement: Wind becomes disruptive specifically above Leong's 2 m/s threshold
   - Prediction: Butterfly abundance shows discontinuous response at 2 m/s boundary
   - Expected pattern: Minimal response below threshold, substantial departures above

3. **Intensity scaling hypothesis:**
   - Statement: Wind's disruptive effects scale proportionally with speed
   - Prediction: Progressively greater abundance decreases with increasing wind speed
   - Expected pattern: Dose-response relationship above threshold

- **Conservation relevance:** Results will provide evidence-based foundation for management decisions as monarch populations face continued threats from habitat loss and climate change
- **Broader significance:** Tests fundamental assumption underlying three decades of conservation investment
