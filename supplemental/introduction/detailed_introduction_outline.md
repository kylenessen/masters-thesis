# Detailed Introduction Outline

## Paragraph 1: General Ecological Context - Biotic and Abiotic Factors

- **Opening:** The distribution and survival of invertebrate species are governed by a complex interplay of biotic and abiotic factors
- **Biotic factors (brief):** Competition for resources, predation pressure, parasitism, mutualistic relationships (cite diverse invertebrate examples)
- **Transition to abiotic:** While biotic interactions shape community dynamics, abiotic conditions often set the fundamental limits on where invertebrates can persist
- **Abiotic examples (diverse invertebrates, NOT monarchs):**
  - Temperature: Desert beetles surviving extreme heat cycles; Antarctic midges tolerating freezing
  - Humidity: Cave arthropods requiring near-saturation; desert scorpions minimizing water loss
  - Solar radiation: Diurnal butterflies timing activity with light; nocturnal moths avoiding damage
  - Precipitation: Temporary pool crustaceans synchronized with rain events
  - Wind: Sets up transition to next paragraph

## Paragraph 2: Wind as Critical Abiotic Factor

- **Wind's diverse impacts on invertebrates:**
  - Dispersal: Spider ballooning exploiting wind for colonization (Bonte & Lens 2007)
  - Foraging: Namibian beetles emerging when wind releases detritus (Hanrahan & Kirchner 1997)
  - Protection: Larvae seeking leeward shelter (Leonard et al. 2016)
  - Communication: Katydids timing calls to avoid wind noise (Velilla et al. 2020)
  - Behavioral thresholds: Cockroach orientation shifts at specific speeds (Bell & Kramer 1979)
- **Wind's multidimensional nature:**
  - Not just average speed but consistency/variability
  - Gustiness and turbulence create different challenges than steady winds
  - Species-specific thresholds trigger distinct behavioral changes
- **End flat:** Wind represents a critical but complex abiotic factor influencing invertebrate behavior

## Paragraph 3: Organisms as Modifiers of Abiotic Conditions

- **Concept introduction:** Many invertebrates exploit habitats where other organisms modify local abiotic conditions
- **Forest structure as key example:**
  - Trees moderate environmental extremes within their canopy
  - Reduce wind speeds through physical barriers
  - Filter and moderate light exposure
  - Buffer temperature fluctuations - cooler maximums, warmer minimums
  - Maintain higher humidity through transpiration and shade
- **Relevance:** This moderation of environmental conditions is fundamental to understanding habitat selection
- **Sets up microclimate discussion:** These modified conditions create distinct microclimates critical for many species

## Paragraph 4: Monarch Butterflies as Study Organism

- **Transition:** The monarch butterfly presents an exceptional system for studying how abiotic factors influence invertebrate ecology
- **Why monarchs are ideal:**
  - Complex life history exposing them to varied environmental conditions
  - Remarkable annual migration spanning continents
  - Clear responses to multiple abiotic factors throughout life cycle
  - Well-documented behavioral ecology
- **Preview:** Their life history demonstrates how temperature, light, wind, and other factors shape behavior across different life stages

## Paragraph 5: Monarch Individual Development and Breeding Phase

- **Individual development:**
  - Temperature governs development rates from egg through metamorphosis
  - Each stage has specific thermal requirements and tolerances
  - Development accelerates with warmth within physiological limits
- **Breeding phase overview:**
  - Multiple generations per year (3-4 in northern range)
  - Rapid reproduction during favorable conditions
  - Each generation exploits milkweed across expanding range
- **Milkweed dependency:**
  - Obligate host plant for larvae
  - Cardiac glycosides provide chemical defense against predators
  - Distribution and phenology constrain breeding opportunities
- **Abiotic constraints during breeding:**
  - Temperature limits development and adult activity
  - Precipitation affects milkweed quality and nectar availability
  - Photoperiod signals seasonal changes

## Paragraph 6: Transition to Migratory Generation

- **Environmental triggers:**
  - Decreasing photoperiod (shorter days)
  - Cooling temperatures
  - Declining milkweed quality
- **Physiological changes creating "super generation":**
  - Juvenile hormone suppression halts reproduction
  - Enhanced lipid accumulation (up to 125% of lean body weight)
  - Extended lifespan (8-9 months vs. 2-5 weeks for breeding generation)
  - Larger body size and wing area
  - Oriented flight behavior emerges
- **Purpose:** These changes prepare monarchs for long-distance migration and extended overwintering period

## Paragraph 7: The Overwintering Phenomenon

- **Why overwinter:**
  - Northern breeding habitat becomes unsuitable (persistent freezing temperatures)
  - Milkweed senesces and disappears from landscape
  - Reproduction impossible under winter conditions
- **Migration destinations:**
  - Eastern population: Oyamel fir forests in Mexican mountains (tens of millions in <30 hectares)
  - Western population: California coastal sites, primarily eucalyptus groves
- **Overwintering goals:**
  - Survive 4-5 months on finite lipid reserves
  - Avoid predation, freezing, desiccation
  - Maintain energy balance without feeding
  - Position for spring remigration to breeding grounds
- **Clustering behavior:**
  - Dense aggregations of thousands to millions
  - Reduces individual surface area exposure
  - Provides thermal benefits and predator protection
- **Challenges:** Storms, temperature fluctuations, predation pressure

## Paragraph 8: Early Research and Original Microclimate Hypothesis

- **Early work (1970s-1980s):**
  - Focus on temperature benefits of clustering (Mexico studies)
  - Recognition of forest structure importance
- **Development in California (Leong 1990):**
  - Synthesized observations into formal "microclimate hypothesis"
  - Proposed specific envelope of suitable conditions
- **Original parameters:**
  - Mild temperatures (~13°C/55°F): Below flight threshold
  - High humidity: Prevent desiccation
  - Dappled sunlight: Allow thermoregulation without triggering dispersal
  - Wind protection (<2 m/s): Prevent physical disruption
- **Underlying principle:** All conditions minimize metabolic expenditure to conserve lipids
- **Widespread adoption:** Became foundation for management guidelines

## Paragraph 9: Gradual Dismantling of Microclimate Hypothesis

- **Temperature component challenged:**
  - Saniee & Villablanca (2022): No temperature differences within groves
  - Temperature varies with latitude (8-18°C gradient across California)
  - Suggests flexible thermal regime, not fixed requirements
- **Humidity component rejected:**
  - No meaningful variation at grove scale (meters)
  - Vapor pressure deficit shows little variation
- **Macroclimate over microclimate:**
  - Fisher et al. (2018): Regional climate better predictor than grove conditions
  - Minimum December temperature most important variable
- **Light - only component with consistent support:**
  - Weiss et al. (1991): Permanent sites at ~20% canopy openness
  - Saniee & Villablanca (2022): Light differences at clusters
  - Remains strongest supported factor
- **Wind - the untested component:**
  - Never directly tested despite 30+ years of management focus
  - No empirical evidence for 2 m/s threshold

## Paragraph 10: Development of Disruptive Wind Hypothesis

- **Timeline of Leong's wind work:**
  - 1990: Initial observation comparing occupied/unoccupied trees
  - 1991: Multivariate analysis reinforcing pattern
  - 1999: Los Osos study credits wind protection
  - 2004: Stronger claims about wind importance
  - 2016: Management guide codifies 2 m/s threshold
- **The specific hypothesis:**
  - Wind >2 m/s physically dislodges butterflies
  - Triggers energetically costly responses
  - Creates unsuitable conditions
- **Methodological limitations:**
  - Only correlational observations
  - Ignored wind complexity (gustiness, turbulence)
  - No consideration of confounding variables
- **Adoption in practice:**
  - Federal/state guidelines mandate 2 m/s protection
  - Restoration designs based on wind modeling (Ellwood Mesa, Pismo Beach)
  - Millions allocated for windbreak plantings

## Paragraph 11: Conservation Imperative

- **Population crisis:**
  - Western monarchs declined to 5% of 1980s abundance
  - Quasi-extinction risk (Schultz et al. 2017)
  - 2024 USFWS proposed threatened listing
- **Management challenge:**
  - Total breeding range spans North America - unmanageable scale
  - Overwintering sites <0.001% of range but critical bottleneck
  - California sites confined to 1.6 km coastal strip
- **Why overwintering sites matter:**
  - Each female can lay 400+ eggs - exponential growth potential
  - Starting population determines seasonal success
  - Best opportunity for population monitoring
  - >50% on state park lands - manageable partnerships
- **Current management:**
  - Heavily based on microclimate hypothesis
  - Special emphasis on wind protection
  - Major investments in restoration (millions of dollars)

## Paragraph 12: Research Gap and Need for Direct Testing

- **The critical gap:**
  - Wind hypothesis drives management but never empirically tested
  - Accepted as fact without causal evidence
  - Millions spent on untested assumption
- **Why direct testing needed:**
  - Correlational observations cannot establish causation
  - Multiple factors covary in nature
  - Confounding variables must be controlled:
    - Solar radiation triggers thermoregulation
    - Temperature affects activity independently
    - Time of day creates patterns
    - Social dynamics influence clustering
- **Wind complexity ignored:**
  - Average vs. maximum speeds
  - Consistency vs. gustiness
  - Turbulence vs. laminar flow
- **Stakes:** With populations threatened, evidence-based management critical

## Paragraph 13: Study Objectives and Hypotheses

- **Primary objective:** First direct empirical test of disruptive wind hypothesis
- **Approach:**
  - Continuous monitoring (30-minute intervals)
  - Simultaneous measurement of wind, temperature, solar radiation
  - Direct observation of butterfly responses
  - Information-theoretic framework for analysis

**Three hierarchical hypotheses:**

1. **Wind as predictor:**
   - Wind predicts abundance changes alongside other factors
   - Prediction: Wind emerges as significant in model selection

2. **Threshold effect:**
   - Disruption occurs specifically above 2 m/s
   - Prediction: Discontinuous response at threshold

3. **Intensity scaling:**
   - Effects proportional to wind speed
   - Prediction: Dose-response relationship

- **Significance:** Will provide evidence-based foundation for three decades of conservation practice
