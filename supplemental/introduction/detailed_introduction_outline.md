# Detailed Introduction Outline

## Paragraph 1: Biotic and Abiotic Factors (Expanded)
**Purpose:** Establish the complex interplay of factors governing invertebrate distribution/survival

- **Opening:** The distribution and survival of invertebrate species are governed by a complex interplay of biotic and abiotic factors
- **Biotic factors examples:**
  - Competition for resources (cite examples)
  - Predation pressure (cite examples)
  - Parasitism and disease (cite examples)
  - Mutualistic relationships (cite examples)
- **Transition to abiotic:** While biotic interactions shape community dynamics, abiotic conditions often set the fundamental limits on where invertebrates can persist
- **Abiotic examples with citations:**
  - Temperature thresholds for development and survival
  - Humidity requirements preventing desiccation
  - Light cycles governing diurnal/seasonal behaviors
  - Precipitation patterns affecting resource availability
- **Other organisms as moderators:** Many invertebrates exploit habitats where vegetation or other organisms moderate extreme conditions, buffering temperature fluctuations and providing shelter

## Paragraph 2: Wind as Critical Abiotic Factor (Expanded)
**Purpose:** Establish wind's importance and multidimensional nature early

- **Wind's diverse impacts on invertebrates:**
  - Dispersal and migration (examples with citations)
  - Foraging efficiency (examples with citations)
  - Predation risk (examples with citations)
  - Energy expenditure (examples with citations)
- **Wind's multidimensional nature:**
  - Not just average speed but consistency/variability
  - Gustiness and turbulence effects
  - Direction and predictability
  - Interaction with other environmental factors
- **Transition:** The monarch butterfly presents an exceptional system for studying these dynamics, as its complex life history exposes it to wind's varied influences across distinct seasonal phases

## Paragraph 3: Monarch Complex Life History
**Purpose:** Provide essential context before discussing conservation (addresses Francis's timing concern)

- **Individual development:** Temperature-dependent development from egg through metamorphosis
- **Breeding phase:** Multiple generations exploiting milkweed across North America
  - Brief note on milkweed's chemical protection conferred to monarchs
  - Temperature and photoperiod constraints on reproduction
- **Transition to diapause:** Environmental cues (temperature, photoperiod) triggering expression changes
  - Juvenile hormone suppression creating "super generation"
  - Larger body size, enhanced lipid storage, extended lifespan
- **Overwintering phase:**
  - Eastern population to Mexican mountains (tens of millions in small area)
  - Western population to California coast (primarily eucalyptus groves)
  - Fixed energy reserves - no feeding, survival on stored lipids
  - Thermal thresholds for flight (12.7-16°C from Masters et al.)
  - Clustering behavior for thermoregulation and predator protection
- **Terminology note:** "Butterfly abundance at overwintering clusters" will be referred to as "monarch abundance" throughout

## Paragraph 4: Conservation Context
**Purpose:** Establish urgency and importance of overwintering sites

- **Population decline:** Western monarchs declined >95% from 1980s highs (Schultz et al. 2017)
- **Federal response:** USFWS proposed threatened listing with critical habitat designation
- **Site management:** >50% of California sites on state park lands
- **Overwintering sites as bottleneck:**
  - Vanishingly small percentage of total habitat (calculate: acres vs. North America)
  - Outsized importance - each female can lay hundreds of eggs
  - Population multiplication potential each generation
  - Best opportunity for population monitoring (Thanksgiving counts)
- **Key threat:** Degradation and loss of overwintering habitat

## Paragraph 5: Original Microclimate Hypothesis
**Purpose:** Present the hypothesis as initially conceived

- **Introduction of hypothesis:** Leong (1990) and others proposed monarchs select groves based on specific microclimate envelope
- **Original parameters:**
  - Mild temperatures (specific range around 55°F originally proposed)
  - High humidity (prevent desiccation)
  - Dappled sunlight (thermoregulation opportunities)
  - Wind protection (<2 m/s threshold)
- **Rationale:** These conditions minimize energy expenditure during months of surviving on finite lipid reserves
- **Management adoption:** Became foundation for decades of conservation planning

## Paragraph 6: Gradual Dismantling of Microclimate Hypothesis
**Purpose:** Show systematic rejection of hypothesis components (Francis's key request)

- **Temperature component rejected:**
  - Saniee & Villablanca (2022) found no temperature differences within groves
  - Temperature ranges vary significantly with latitude across California
  - Not a fixed envelope but variable parameter space
- **Humidity component rejected:**
  - No meaningful variation detected within groves (Saniee & Villablanca 2022)
  - Air temperature and humidity don't vary meaningfully over meters
- **Macroclimate over microclimate:**
  - Fisher et al. (2018) - habitat suitability models suggest grove-level factors more important
  - Challenges the within-grove heterogeneity assumption
- **Light remains partially supported:**
  - Some evidence for importance (Weiss et al. 1991 - ISF measurements)
  - Saniee & Villablanca found light differences at cluster sites
- **Wind - the untested component:**
  - Never directly tested despite widespread adoption
  - Remains the primary focus of management interventions

## Paragraph 7: The Disruptive Wind Hypothesis
**Purpose:** Detail the specific wind claims and their adoption

- **Development timeline:**
  - 1990: Leong identifies pattern comparing occupied/unoccupied trees
  - 1991: Reinforces findings with multivariate analysis
  - 1999: Osos manipulation credits wind protection
  - 2004: Additional claims about wind importance
  - 2016: Management guide makes strongest claims about 2 m/s threshold
- **The hypothesis:** Wind >2 m/s physically dislodges butterflies or triggers energetically costly escape responses
- **Adoption in practice:**
  - Incorporated into federal/state management guidelines
  - Shapes restoration plans (Pismo, Ellwood Mesa examples)
  - Millions in conservation funding allocated based on this threshold
- **Critical gap:** Entirely based on correlational observations, never experimentally tested

## Paragraph 8: Need for Direct Testing with Confounding Variables
**Purpose:** Justify the experimental approach (Francis's lines 129-132)

- **Observational limitations:**
  - Leong's approach compared sites but couldn't establish causation
  - Initial observations identify plausible hypotheses, not conclusions
- **Confounding variables problem:**
  - Temperature and solar radiation trigger butterfly movement independent of wind
  - Thermoregulation needs vs. wind avoidance cannot be separated observationally
  - Time of day effects confounded with environmental conditions
- **Need for controlled approach:**
  - Must isolate wind effects from thermal drivers
  - Requires continuous monitoring of all variables simultaneously
  - Direct observation of butterfly responses to measured wind events

## Paragraph 9: Study Objectives and Hypotheses
**Purpose:** Clear statement of research goals

- **Objective:** First direct empirical test of disruptive wind hypothesis
- **Approach:** Continuous time-series observations with simultaneous environmental monitoring
- **Information-theoretic framework:** Test relative importance of predictors

**Three hierarchical hypotheses:**
1. **Wind as predictor:** Wind (alongside temperature, sunlight, time) predicts monarch abundance changes
   - Prediction: Wind will emerge as significant in model selection

2. **Threshold effect:** Disruption occurs specifically above 2 m/s
   - Prediction: Abundance declines when wind exceeds threshold

3. **Scaling with intensity:** Effects proportional to wind speed
   - Prediction: Greater decreases with increasing wind speed above threshold

- **Closing:** Results will directly inform evidence-based management as monarchs face continued threats
