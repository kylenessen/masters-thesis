The microclimate hypothesis, largely pioneered by Kingston L. H. Leong and colleagues, represents a crucial conceptual model in monarch butterfly conservation ecology, particularly for the western migratory population overwintering along the California coast. My review will affirm the historical validity of the paragraph while utilizing subsequent research from the sources to refine the mechanistic understanding and address the critical issue of scale and uniformity in habitat selection, as warranted by a PhD-level analysis.

## Important quotes from Leong

- 1990:"During winter storms, the butterflies clustered on those few trees that offered the greatest protection against winds of «2 m/s or greater."
  - Note: highest wind speed observed was 1.66 m/s
- 1991 "Butterflies cluster in areas of the grove that offer exposure to filtered sunlight and shelter from strong wind movement (Leong 1990)."
  - Highest wind observed was 0.85 m/s
- 1999: "Overwintering butterflies were attracted to the altered area of the grove almost immediately during the first and second wintering season, but abandoned the grove, in both seasons, when high wind velocities from winter storms infiltrated the areas where they gathered."
- 1999: "Roosting butterflies were blown from their clusters or dislodged by excessive branch movements (shaking) caused by winds exceeding 2 m/sec (unpublished data). Upon dislodgment, the butterflies flew to and resettled on foliage of trees that offered better shelter from strong winds. If strong storm winds occurred in early morning hours, when ambient temperatures were below 55oC, the dislodged butterflies would be blown to the ground and remain there until temperatures reached flight threshold. Butterflies littering the ground at the base of roosting trees were commonly observed in early morning after a winter storm. The sensitivity of the butterflies to wind movement was documented by Leong (1990), who found that trees supporting roosting butterflies were assoicated with significant lower wind velocities than trees that once supported winter aggregations."
- 1999: "In winter 1994–1995, within a week of grove modification, 50 overwintering butterflies clustered on the foliage of two trees bordering the northwestern end of the clearing in area A (star in Figure 3b). These butterflies remained for a month and abandoned the grove when a single storm brought winds in excess of 2 m/sec. The path and possible effect of strong winds can be illustrated by shading all sample locales within the grove during the season that recorded winds of 2 m/sec or greater. As portrayed, NW winds greater than 2 m/sec traveled through the grove in a funnel pattern, directly through the clustering area (Fig. 3b). The apex of this wind funnel pattern was a dead eucalyptus tree, suggesting a breach in wind protection by the grove’s perimeter trees."
- 1999: "summary, overwintering butterflies respond favorably to the purposeful modification of a degraded winter grove. The greater accessibility of filtered sunlight into the grove helped to reestablish conditions conducive for winter aggregations. The stability of these conditions, however, was greatly influenced by the infiltration of high winds (>2 m/sec) into the cluster arena. The grove’s seasonal wind profile is useful to determine where plantings of tree seedlings could be most effective in buffering future disruptive winds. Sheltering the overwintering butterflies against strong winds will greatly increase the habitat’s suitability and perhaps its carrying capacity for winter aggregations."
- 2004: "Sites where clustering occurs throughout the winter season provide protection against prevailing winds from the north and northwest and winter storm winds from the  south (Leong 1999)."
- 2004: "These often support roosting monarchs early in the season but are generally abandoned when  weather conditions, such as strong winds, disrupt the roosting area (Leong 1999)."
- 2016: "Monarch Butterflies are very sensitive to winds, forming winter aggregations on trees exposed to minimal winds and on foliage that buffers prevailing winds (Leong 1990). Field studies of butterfly sites I conducted at Los Osos, Purple Gate, Nipomo, and Sweet Springs, in California, have consistently showed that strong winds have a direct negative effect on the winter occupancy of a grove by butterflies (Leong 1990, 1997; Leong et al. 1991, 2004). Winds ≥ 2 m/s are disruptive to the aggregating butterflies by blowing them from their roosting branches or dislodging them by shaking the branches. When the butterflies observed in this study were subjected to winds above flight threshold (about 16° C), they either flew to a more sheltered area of the grove or, if no refuge area was available, abandoned the grove temporarily or for the remainder of the season.If subjected to these winds below flight threshold, they were dislodged from their roost and blown to the ground where they lay like scattered leaves until warmed by ambient temperatures and able to fly to neighboring foliage or to ultimately abandon the grove."

The Foundational Microclimate Hypothesis (Leong, 1990)
Early research on overwintering monarchs established the fundamental role of forest structure in mitigating extreme environmental conditions (Anderson & Brower, 1996; Masters et al., 1988). The Mexican sites, located at high altitude, necessitated clustering and dense forest cover (oyamel fir, Abies religiosa) to act as a thermal "blanket and an umbrella," critically mitigating radiant heat loss and wetting to prevent freezing mortality (Anderson & Brower, 1996; Calvert et al., 1983; Flockhart et al., 2015).
Building on these insights, Leong (1990) formally synthesized field observations from central California sites to propose that western monarchs select groves based on a measurable microenvironmental envelope. This proposed hypothesis dictated management strategies for decades (Bell et al., 1993; Pelton et al., 2016).
Core Parameters of the Original Hypothesis:

1. Wind Protection: The avoidance of wind was deemed the single most key environmental factor governing roosting behavior and movements within a grove (Leong, 1990). The hypothesis posits that wind speeds exceeding 2 m/s result in the physical disruption and dislodgement of butterflies from clusters (Frey & Leong, 1993). Maintaining wind shelter remains a primary goal of habitat management, especially given the vulnerability of sites compromised by drought-related tree mortality (Ellwood Tech Report, 2023).
2. Thermal Regulation and Diapause: Overwintering requires cool, mild temperatures to maintain reproductive diapause and minimize metabolic rates, thereby conserving essential lipid reserves (Masters et al., 1988). Western overwintering sites typically exhibit lower diurnal temperature fluctuations than Mexican sites, providing a relatively stable thermal environment (Brower et al., 2008; Freedman et al., 2021).
3. Dappled Sunlight (Thermoregulation): Monarch clusters require protection from intense solar radiation but must also allow access to filtered or dappled sunlight for behavioral thermoregulation, enabling them to reach flight threshold temperatures without triggering metabolic hyperactivity or dispersal (Weiss et al., 1991). The placement of clusters often reflects a compromise, utilizing the southern exposures of trees while remaining sheltered (Frey & Leong, 1993).
4. Humidity/Moisture: High humidity and easily accessible sources of moisture (like morning dew) are critical to prevent desiccation, a factor particularly pronounced along the central California coast (Leong et al., 2004; Saniee & Villablanca, 2022).
Nuances and Refinements: Addressing Scale and Uniformity
While the original paragraph accurately describes the parameters observed in the 1990s, modern ecophysiological and spatial ecology studies, including those explicitly testing Leong's model, suggest a crucial refinement regarding the predictability and uniformity of the microclimate niche (Fisher et al., 2018; Saniee & Villablanca, 2022).
1. Rejection of a Uniform Niche
The implicit assumption that monarchs select a single, universal microclimate profile across the entire coastal range (non-hierarchical selection) has been empirically challenged.
• Testing the hypothesis that monarchs select for a uniform microclimatic niche across groves, researchers found that microclimatic attributes—including light, temperature, and humidity—were not uniform across overwintering aggregation locations.
• Instead, there is evidence that microclimatic attributes in aggregation locations are statistically influenced by their position in the landscape (Saniee & Villablanca, 2022). This suggests the realized microclimatic niche is geographically variable (Fisher et al., 2018).
• The selection process seems hierarchical, meaning that local environmental variables (e.g., specific cluster conditions) are nested within larger, geographically variable conditions (Saniee & Villablanca, 2022).
1. Importance of Scale in Selection
Ecological modeling emphasizes that selection occurs across multiple spatial scales (Johnson, 1980; Lawler & Torgersen, 2020).
• Grove Scale (Macro-level): Monarchs demonstrate habitat selection at the scale of the entire grove location, favoring sites near the coast, at low elevations, and with gentle slopes (Fisher, 2023). However, characteristics like "south-west facing aspect," though often cited, have been found in some studies to merely reflect common coastal topography rather than explicit monarch selection at the grove scale (Fisher, 2023).
• Aggregation Scale (Micro-level): Within a selected grove, monarchs utilize the grove interior which exhibits energetically favorable conditions compared to exposed edges (Saniee & Villablanca, 2022). The ability of the grove interior to buffer conditions prevents environmental stochasticity from increasing metabolic expenditure (Fisher et al., 2018; Saniee & Villablanca, 2022).
In conclusion, Leong's seminal hypothesis correctly identified the critical mechanisms (lipid conservation, wind avoidance, thermoregulation) that drive habitat selection. However, subsequent testing revealed that the resulting niche envelope (the set of acceptable physical parameters) is not rigid or uniform across the entire range, but rather exhibits a high degree of spatial plasticity correlated with latitude and local geography (Saniee & Villablanca, 2022). This insight is vital for conservation efforts, especially when projecting species viability under scenarios of future climate change (Fisher et al., 2018).
