Monarch butterflies, as ectotherms, rely heavily on behavioral and physiological adaptations to manage their thermal budgets throughout the overwintering period (Chaplin & Wells, 1982; Fisher et al., 2023). The selection of specific overwintering microclimates—both in California and Mexico—is a direct mechanism to facilitate necessary thermoregulation and minimize energetic expenditure, underpinning the lipid energy budget hypothesis (Masters et al., 1988; Chaplin & Wells, 1982)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thermoregulatory Behavior and Flight Threshold
The microclimatic conditions sought by overwintering monarchs necessitate a precise balance: temperatures must be cool enough to conserve energy but warm enough to permit essential movement (Urquhart, 1976, cited in Alonso-Mejía et al., 1993; Masters et al., 1988).
The Flight Threshold (Masters et al., 1988)
Masters et al. (1988) investigated the relationship between temperature and performance for monarchs overwintering in Mexico, establishing critical thermal boundaries for activity.

1. Definition of Flight Threshold: Based on tests where butterflies were assessed for their ability to remain aloft immediately after thoracic temperature ($T_{th}$) measurement, the authors set the flight threshold range for Mexican overwintering monarchs at $12.7^{\circ}\text{C}$ to $16.0^{\circ}\text{C}$ (Masters et al., 1988; Fisher et al., 2023).
2. Mechanisms to Achieve Flight: Since ambient shade temperatures ($T_a$) in the high-altitude oyamel fir forests seldom reach this flight threshold (Masters et al., 1988; Brower et al., 2011), monarchs employ active thermoregulation:
    ◦ Shivering (Endothermy): Monarchs can raise their $T_{th}$ by shivering (small-amplitude wingstrokes), an endothermic activity that generates internal heat through muscle contraction (Kammer, 1970; Masters et al., 1988). Shivering, coupled with basking, delays the decline of $T_{th}$ below the flight threshold (Masters et al., 1988). When $T_a$ is near, but below, the flight threshold, shaded monarchs can use shivering to attain flight capability (Masters et al., 1988). For instance, at ambient temperatures $1^{\circ}\text{C}$ to $3^{\circ}\text{C}$ below the flight threshold, shivering allows monarchs to reach the necessary $T_{th}$ for flight (Alonso-Mejía et al., 1993; Brower et al., 2011).
    ◦ Basking (Ectothermy): Upon exposure to sunlight, monarchs immediately bask dorsally, warming rapidly to the flight threshold within less than 30 seconds and quickly rising above it within one minute (Masters et al., 1988). Basking is a passive Newtonian process requiring minimal energy expenditure compared to shivering or powered flight (Masters et al., 1988).
3. Adaptive Behavior: Monarchs dislodged onto the ground due to wind or cold often shiver and crawl up nearby vegetation to reach warmer thermal zones, mitigating both freezing mortality and the formation of dew, which dramatically reduces their supercooling ability (Alonso-Mejía et al., 1992; Calvert & Cohen, 1983; Masters et al., 1988; Anderson & Brower, 1996).
Thermoregulation and Avoidance of High Temperature
While freezing is a major mortality source in Mexico, particularly for wetted individuals exposed to sub-zero $T_a$ (Anderson & Brower, 1996; Calvert et al., 1983), the avoidance of high temperatures is equally crucial to overwintering success (Masters et al., 1988; Oberhauser & Peterson, 2003).
Dangers of Overheating
Temperatures above the optimal range impose multiple physiological constraints on overwintering monarchs:
1. Lipid Depletion: Higher body temperatures significantly increase the metabolic rate, thereby accelerating the consumption of critically limited lipid reserves (Chaplin & Wells, 1982; Masters et al., 1988).
2. Diapause Termination: Ambient temperatures above approximately $20^{\circ}\text{C}$ may compromise reproductive diapause, potentially triggering courtship, reproductive tract development (oocyte maturation), and premature remigration (Barker & Herman, 1976; Herman, 1985; Masters et al., 1988; Oberhauser & Peterson, 2003). The California coastal climate, for instance, has average maximum daily temperatures (MaDT) that are regularly close to or surpassing the minimum temperature required for oocyte maturation (Fisher et al., 2023).
Avoidance Behaviors
To counter overheating, monarchs actively regulate their $T_{th}$:
• Sun-Minimizing Postures: When monarch $T_{th}$ reaches an average of $33.6^{\circ}\text{C}$—or upon reaching $30^{\circ}\text{C}$—butterflies will switch behaviors to reduce radiant heat gain by adopting a sun-minimizing posture (Masters et al., 1988; Fisher et al., 2023). This behavior helps prevent heat stress and reduces the rate of lipid consumption (Masters et al., 1988; Douglas, 1978, cited in Masters et al., 1988).
• Gliding and Flying: Individuals exposed to intense sun within a cluster may fly out and glide above the colony, intentionally losing heat to the cold ambient environment (Masters et al., 1988). Flying monarchs lose thoracic heat, even in full sunlight, and their $T_{th}$ stabilizes at a lower temperature than those actively basking (Masters et al., 1988).
• Cluster Buffering: Dense clusters, particularly those inside the Mexican oyamel forest, provide microclimatic advantages by buffering against heating during warm days, helping the interior monarchs remain cooler and thereby reducing the rate at which they consume lipid stores (Brower et al., 2008; Masters et al., 1988).
The Lipid Energy Budget Hypothesis
The overriding adaptive strategy of monarch overwintering is the conservation of lipid reserves (Masters et al., 1988; Chaplin & Wells, 1982; Tuskes & Brower, 1978). These lipids are the finite energy source that must sustain them for months of survival and fuel the necessary spring remigration (Masters et al., 1988; Brown & Chippendale, 1974, cited in Masters et al., 1988; Leong et al., 2020).
Energetic Costs of Activity
The core mechanism for maximizing survival relies on minimizing metabolic expenditure during the quiescent winter period:
• Temperature Dependence: Metabolic rate, measured by oxygen consumption, increases exponentially with temperature (Chaplin & Wells, 1982; Masters et al., 1988; Saniee & Villablanca, 2022). Therefore, selecting a cool microclimate is the primary mechanism for conserving energy (Masters et al., 1988).
• Cost of Movement: Behavioral thermoregulation, while necessary for survival and accessing water or nectar, is highly energy-intensive (Masters et al., 1988; Chaplin & Wells, 1982):
    ◦ Powered Flight: Flying at a $T_{th}$ of $22^{\circ}\text{C}$ expends energy about 31 times as fast as resting in the shade at the same temperature (Masters et al., 1988). Flying at $15.5^{\circ}\text{C}$ expends energy roughly 28 times as fast as resting (Masters et al., 1988).
    ◦ Shivering: Shivering is also costly, consuming energy 25 times faster than resting at $15.5^{\circ}\text{C}$ (Masters et al., 1988).
The Role of Microclimate in Budget Maintenance
The specific microclimate parameters selected (cool temperatures, shade/dappled light, wind protection) work synergistically to maintain a favorable lipid budget (Chaplin & Wells, 1982; Leong, 1990, 2016).
• Quiescence: Monarchs overwintering in California and Mexico enter the aggregation period with substantial lipid reserves, which decline steadily during the quiescent period (Chaplin & Wells, 1982; Tuskes & Brower, 1978). The selection of microhabitats with low maximum daily temperatures (MaDT) allows monarchs to maintain low internal body temperature, which is essential for survival (Masters et al., 1988; Saniee & Villablanca, 2022).
• Avoiding Wastage: The high metabolic cost of activity means that monarchs must severely restrict their expensive endothermic activities (Masters et al., 1988). The goal is to remain in the shade as much as possible, as estimates of lipid use demonstrate that individuals heating to high temperatures (e.g., $33.6^{\circ}\text{C}$) burn lipids 2.4 times faster per hour than those engaging in short flights and resting (Masters et al., 1988).
• Management Implications: The conservation principle derived from this hypothesis is that forest structure must remain intact (the "blanket and umbrella") because thinning increases exposure to freezing at night and to high temperatures and wind velocity during the day (Anderson & Brower, 1996; Calvert et al., 1982; Williams & Brower, 2015). Increased activity (flying to water more frequently, shivering when dislodged by wind, or basking/nectaring) all drastically increase the rate of lipid consumption, potentially leading to starvation or insufficient fuel for remigration (Alonso-Mejía et al., 1997; Masters et al., 1988; Commission for Environmental Cooperation, 1997).
