Wind is recognized as a primary abiotic factor influencing monarch butterfly survival and management across the sources, particularly concerning the conservation and restoration of critical overwintering habitats along the California coast. Management practices heavily focus on mitigating the negative impacts of high wind and severe storms to ensure the necessary microclimatic conditions are maintained [Jepsen et al. 2015; The Xerces Society 2017].

1. Importance of Wind Protection in Overwintering Habitat
For western monarchs overwintering in coastal California groves, protection from winds and storms is an essential habitat requirement [The Xerces Society 2017; Jepsen et al. 2015].
• Microclimate Requirements: Overwintering sites must provide protection from freezing temperatures and high winds [Xerces Society 2020; WAFWA 2019]. The forest canopy structure must create a protective microclimate that acts as a "thermal blanket and a rain umbrella" [Xerces Society 2020; The Xerces Society 2017].
• Consequences of High Wind: The monarch habitat must be sufficiently dense to offer protection from strong winds and winter storms [The Xerces Society 2017; Leong 1990a; Leong et al. 1991; Weiss et al. 1991]. Monarchs cannot persist at sites experiencing high wind speeds [Xerces Society 2020; Leong 1990b; Leong 1991].
• Severe Weather Threats: Natural factors, such as severe storms and high winds, can alter the forest structure and microclimate of a site, reducing its suitability for monarchs [The Xerces Society 2017; Jepsen et al. 2015; Sakai & Calvert 1991; Commission for Environmental Cooperation 2008]. Severe storms are also identified as a general threat to eastern monarchs in the context of climate change [Jepsen et al. 2015].
2. Monitoring and Assessment of Wind Exposure
Management guidance emphasizes detailed assessment of wind conditions to inform proactive intervention.
• Habitat Characterization: Site stewardship plans require characterizing stand structure and microclimate, specifically listing wind as a factor to be measured [Weiss & Rich 2008; Weiss et al. 2008].
• Use of Technology: Hemispherical photography is a key technique used to characterize canopy geometry and calculate solar and wind exposure at overwintering sites [The Xerces Society 2017; Weiss et al. 2008; Weiss et al. 1991; Weiss & Luth 2002; Weiss 1998; Leong 1990; Leong et al. 1991]. This method allows for assessment of canopy structure and its effect on wind exposure with a high degree of detail [The Xerces Society 2017; Weiss et al. 1991, 2012; Weiss 1998, 2011].
• Field Monitoring: Managers should measure wind speed and direction within the grove and compare these results to baseline measurements taken outside the grove to develop a wind profile [The Xerces Society 2017].
• Scenario Modeling: Advanced analysis uses simulation models to determine the impacts of hypothetical tree loss or tree additions on light and wind conditions [Xerces Society 2020]. Modeling at Pismo Beach demonstrated the "overwhelming importance" of off-site trees in providing wind shelter [Xerces Society 2020].
• Identifying Deficiencies: The comparison of wind measurements helps reveal areas where wind protection may be insufficient outside of the cluster area [The Xerces Society 2017]. Windbreak trees can be located more than 110 yards (100 m) away from the monarch habitat boundary [The Xerces Society 2017; Weiss 1998].
3. Management Strategies for Wind Mitigation
Management focuses on maintaining or restoring the structural integrity of the canopy, especially the windbreaks, often planning several decades into the future to replace tree function [The Xerces Society 2017; Weiss 1998, 2011; Leong 1999].
• Windbreak Zones: Management plans recommend designating a specific Windbreak Zone where dense planting is necessary to provide solar and wind protection [Weiss & Rich 2008].
• Proactive Planting: If monitoring reveals that an area is susceptible to high winds or storm winds due to tree removal or storm damage, planting fast-growing trees is "imperative to close the gap" [The Xerces Society 2017].
• Planting Density and Structure: To ensure suitable wind protection, multiple rows of trees can be planted, with trees offset by approximately 3 ft (1 m) to avoid creating straight wind tunnels [The Xerces Society 2017; Weiss & Luth 2002]. A multi-storied forest structure is preferred, and managers must avoid disrupting this structure, which provides wind shelter, when conducting fuel management [The Xerces Society 2017]. Mid-story vegetation is explicitly cited as crucial for wind protection of the clusters [The Xerces Society 2017].
• Species Selection for Shelter:
    ◦ Eucalyptus: Nonnative Eucalyptus species, particularly blue gum, are often used in restoration plans because they are fast-growing and provide excellent wind and solar protection quickly, making them valuable in the immediate crisis [Xerces Society 2020; Weiss & Rich 2008].
    ◦ Native Trees: Native trees like Monterey cypress, Arroyo willow, California bay, and California wax myrtle are recommended to diversify or create buffer zones for mid-story wind protection [Xerces Society 2020].
• Off-Site Management: Due to the critical role external structures play in buffering wind, managers are advised to coordinate with adjacent landowners (like the Union Pacific Railroad or Caltrans) to ensure the maintenance or replacement of trees that function as essential windbreaks [Xerces Society 2020; Xerces Society 2017].
• Operational Safety: State Parks practice includes closing the overwintering grove during periods of high wind and rain, as these conditions increase the risk of blue gum eucalyptus trees shedding large limbs or failing, posing a threat to human safety [Xerces Society 2020].
