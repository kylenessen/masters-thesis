# Introduction Outline: A Funnel Approach

This is a brainstorm on how to expand my introduction, structured as a funnel from broad concepts to the specific research question.

### 1. Broad Opening: Biotic and Abiotic Factors

The entry point for the introduction is that biotic and abiotic factors influence invertebrate species distribution, behavior, and where you might find them. 

*   **Biotic Factors**: To address the biotic element, I will include one to two sentences with a few examples of how invertebrates are affected by biotic conditions.
*   **Transition to Abiotic**: Quickly move on from biotic factors to focus on abiotic factors.

### 2. Narrowing Focus: Key Abiotic Factors

This section needs a wide gate. I will find papers on various abiotic factors to demonstrate the breadth of their influence. I must include examples that are relevant to my study to help justify their inclusion in my model. I can spend more time on this section.

*   **Factors to Include**: Temperature, humidity, exposure to direct light (solar radiation), time of day, and ambient temperature. These are all tidy examples that support my model's variables.

### 3. Deep Dive on a Specific Factor: Wind

I will dedicate a whole, lengthy paragraph to how wind affects the behavior of invertebrate species. I have fortunately already done a lot of work on this and believe I have found all the necessary papers.

### 4. Introducing the Model Organism: The Monarch Butterfly

There's a bit of a jump here. I will introduce monarch butterflies as an iconic, charismatic species worthy of study, particularly for understanding how abiotic factors influence their behavior. 

Within this paragraph, I will give a brief overview of their migration:
*   **Spring/Summer**: They radiate across North America, reproducing on milkweed.
*   **Fall/Winter**: They retreat to overwintering grounds to wait out the unfavorable times of the year before beginning the reproductive cycle again.

### 5. Focusing on Overwintering Behavior

The next paragraph will get more specific about the overwintering phase. 

*   Discuss the potential reasons why monarchs engage in this behavior.
*   Briefly mention the overwintering sites in Mexico.
*   Introduce the idea of overwintering groves in California, which are primarily coastal.
*   Cite Ashley's and Kiana's papers here to discuss the macro-level climatic variables that overwintering habitat provides and what we know in that regard.

### 6. The Micro-Level: The Microclimate Hypothesis

Transition from the macro-level (grove characteristics) to the micro-level (how monarchs select sites *within* these groves). 

*   Introduce the microclimate hypothesis and discuss it in great detail.

### 7. Pinpointing the Key Variable: Wind in Overwintering Groves

This section will introduce the story of how wind was identified as a key factor.

*   Detail how the idea of wind's importance was originally identified, reinforced in the literature, and ultimately consolidated in the best management practices for managing overwintering groves.
*   Cite multiple examples where wind became the marquee abiotic condition to manage for in different projects. I can cite the ones I've been involved with, but it would be good to find others as well.
*   I must cite the Xerces Society's Land Manager's Guide.

### 8. The Research Gap and Study Purpose

To transition to the conclusion, I will state that the role of wind, despite its accepted importance, has never been empirically tested. 

*   This establishes the purpose of our study.
*   State our hypotheses.
*   Conclude the introduction.
