- Innovative and interesting paper that tracked cockroach movement on a
  large sphere. The stats were a bit confusing, but looking at the
  tracks, there is a clear shift in behavior in response to their
  strongest wind treatments. A nice example of behavioral shift in
  response to a wind threshold.

- This paper focuses more on the heritability of spider ballooning, but
  has many citations describing the general phenomenon. This behavior is
  when spiders "tiptoe" to the top of a branch, send out some silk, and
  float away to hopefully new and better habitat. This appears to be a
  well known topic with many papers describing spider ballooning. An
  example of how invertebrates use wind to their favor.

- Interesting paper that studied sand dune beetles in Africa. They
  demonstrated that beetles come out to forage in higher numbers when
  winds reach above a certain threshold. The idea is that these dunes
  are unvegetated, and the wind will release detritus from the sand.
  Most of the time, the beetles are buried, and emerge based on a signal
  from vibrating sand.

- A somewhat weak paper that shows larvae will move more in wind
  treatments, generally finding the leeward sides of leaves. Most of the
  value here is a quick example and all of the promising citations in
  the introduction.

- I really enjoyed this paper, as it provided an argument for a more
  wholistic approach to understanding biological phenomena. The paper
  may be more appropriate for the Pismo project, as it argues for
  incorporating CFD, and then provides examples of systems that would
  benefit (e.g., spider ballooning). Perhaps not useful for VSFB.

- This seemed like such a promising paper, where it was cited in another
  article claiming that a particular insect preferred locations highly
  shielded from the wind. It turns out, the paper only describes the
  observation, and no attempt at a study to demonstrate that phenomenon
  was presented. I had lots of red flags when reading this paper.

- This was a high quality paper with a great experimental design. They
  studied aquatic invertebrates that colonized ephemeral pools. It was a
  metapopulation study, and showed that wind is a critical abiotic
  factor to dispersal. They also suggest a reversal of the normal ideas
  around source and sink populations, where the ephemeral pools are the
  source.

- Pretty good paper that convinced me that neotropical katydids will
  modify their behavior in response to wind. Specifically, they will
  preferentially call at night when wind speeds are the lowest. This is
  to avoid auditory competition with vibrations caused by the wind.
  Gentle winds allow for a clear signal. We should consider publishing
  in this journal.
