These are notes from meeting with the library about formatting.  

1. Change all dates to December 2025 pg 1 and 2
2. Change title to title case
3. Change sections to chapters (e.g. chapter 1 intro, chapter 2 materials )
4. For figures first sentence should be bold and match list of figures. Then caption can follow.
